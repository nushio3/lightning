However, it is difficult to program hybrid architectures and there is no commonly accepted programming model. Ideally, applications should be written in a way that is portable to many platforms, but providing this portability for general programs is a hard problem. By restricting the class of programs considered, we can make this portability feasible. We present Liszt, a domain-specific language for constructing mesh-based {PDE} solvers. We introduce language statements for interacting with an unstructured mesh, and storing data at its elements. Program analysis of these statements enables our compiler to expose the parallelism, locality, and synchronization of Liszt programs. Using this analysis, we generate applications for multiple platforms: a cluster, an {SMP}, and a {GPU.} This approach allows Liszt applications to perform within 12\% of hand-written C++, scale to large clusters, and experience order-of-magnitude speedups on {GPUs.}},

stratification. Starting with a weak vertical seed field, a saturated 
state is obtained after a few tens of orbits in which the energy in the 
predominantly toroidal magnetic field is still subthermal. The 
efficiency of angular momentum transport, parameterized by the 
Shakura-Sunyaev alpha -parameter, is of the order of 10{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} . The 
dominant contribution to alpha comes from magnetic stresses, which are 
enhanced by the presence of weak net vertical fields. The power spectra 
of the magnetic fields are flat or decline only slowly toward the 
largest scales accessible in the calculation, suggesting that the 
viscosity arising from {MHD} turbulence may not be a locally determined 
quantity. I discuss how these results compare with observationally 
inferred values of alpha and possible implications for models of jet 
formation.},

	abstract = {The optimum design, construction, and use of the Laser Interferometer 
Gravitational Wave Observatory ({LIGO)}, {VIRGO}, or Laser Gravitational 
Wave Observatory ({LAGOS)} gravitational radiation detectors depends upon 
accurate calculations of their sensitivity to different sources of 
radiation. Here I examine how to determine the sensitivity of these 
instruments to sources of gravitational radiation by considering the 
process by which data are analyzed in a noisy detector. The problem of 
detection (is a signal present in the output of the detector{\textbackslash}?) is 
separated from that of measurement (what are the parameters that 
characterize the signal in the detector output{\textbackslash}?). By constructing the 
probability that the detector output is consistent with the presence of 
a signal, I show how to quantify the uncertainty that the output 
contains a signal and is not simply noise. Proceeding further, I 
construct the probability distribution that the parametrization μ 
that characterizes the signal has a certain value. From the distribution 
and its mode I determine volumes V(P) in parameter space such that 
{μ∈V(P)} with probability P [owing to the random nature of the 
detector noise, the volumes V(P) are always different, even for 
identical signals in the detector output], thus quantifying the 
uncertainty in the estimation of the signal parametrization. These 
techniques are suitable for analyzing the output of a noisy detector. If 
we are designing a detector, or determining the suitability of an 
existing detector for observing a new source, then we do not have 
detector output to analyze but are interested in the ``most likely'' 
response of the detector to a signal. I exploit the techniques just 
described to determine the ``most likely'' volumes V(P) for detector 
output that would result in a parameter probability distribution with 
given mode. Finally, as an example, I apply these techniques to 
determine the anticipated sensitivity of the {LIGO} and {LAGOS} detectors to 
the gravitational radiation from a perturbed Kerr black hole.},

We find that, in general, the growing modes are overstable. We also report a new, global version of the instability of Balbus \& Hawley that sets in for some, but not all, boundary conditions. This global instability can occur even when the magnetic field is strong. The existence of this global instability explains the difference between the instability criterion of Papaloizou \& Szuszkiewicz and the instability criterion derived from a local analysis by Balbus \& Hawley.

	abstract = {The present operation of the ground-based network of gravitational-wave laser interferometers in enhanced configuration and the beginning of the construction of second-generation (or advanced) interferometers with planned observation runs beginning by 2015 bring the search for gravitational waves into a regime where detection is highly plausible. The development of techniques that allow us to discriminate a signal of astrophysical origin from instrumental artefacts in the interferometer data and to extract the full range of information are therefore some of the primary goals of the current work. Here we report the details of a Bayesian approach to the problem of inference for gravitational wave observations using a network (containing an arbitrary number) of instruments, for the computation of the Bayes factor between two hypotheses and the evaluation of the marginalized posterior density functions of the unknown model parameters. The numerical algorithm to tackle the notoriously difficult problem of the evaluation of large multidimensional integrals is based on a technique known as nested sampling, which provides an attractive (and possibly superior) alternative to more traditional Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods. We discuss the details of the implementation of this algorithm and its performance against a Gaussian model of the background noise, considering the specific case of the signal produced by the in-spiral of binary systems of black holes and/or neutron stars, although the method is completely general and can be applied to other classes of sources. We also demonstrate the utility of this approach by introducing a new coherence test to distinguish between the presence of a coherent signal of astrophysical origin in the data of multiple instruments and the presence of incoherent accidental artefacts, and the effects on the estimation of the source parameters as a function of the number of instruments in the network.},

	abstract = {How planetesimals are created from tiny dust particles in a proto-planetary disk before the dust particles spiral to the central star is one of the most challenging problems in the theory of planetary system formation. In our previous paper, we have shown that a steady angular velocity profile that consists of both super- and sub-Keplerian regions is created in the disk through non-uniform excitation of magneto-rotational instability ({MRI).} Such non-uniform {MRI} excitation is reasonably expected in a part of disks with relatively low ionization degree. In this paper, we show through three-dimensional resistive {MHD} simulations with test particles that this radial structure of the angular velocity indeed leads to the prevention of spiral-in of dust particles and furthermore to their accumulation at the boundary of super-Keplerian and sub-Keplerian regions. Treating dust particles as test particles, their motions under the influence of the non-uniform {MRI} through gas drag are simulated. In the most favorable cases (meter-size dust particles in the disk region with a relatively large fraction of {MRI-stable} region), we found that the dust concentration is peaked around the super/sub-Keplerian flow boundary and the peak dust density is 10,000 times as high as the initial value. The peak density is high enough for the subsequent gravitational instability to set in, suggesting a possible route to planetesimal formation via non-uniformly excited {MRI} in weakly ionized regions of a disk.},

	abstract = {We put forward a model for accretion disks around T Tauri stars. The model assumes that angular momentum transport is driven by magnetic fields and can occur only in those parts of the disk that are sufficiently ionized that the gas can couple to the magnetic field. These regions lie at R ≲ 0.1 {AU}, where collisional ionization is effective, and at R ≲ 0.1 {AU} in a layer of thickness ≍ 100 g cm-2 at the surface of the disk where cosmic-ray ionization is effective. The model predicts that the stellar accretion rate is about 10-8 Msun yr-1, independent of the rate of infall onto the disk. Matter that is not accreted onto the star accumulates in the inner few {AU} of the disk at a rate of about 10-3 Msun in 104 yr. Given this buildup it is unlikely that accretion is steady. The effective temperature profile is Te ˜ r-1/2 outside of 0.1 {AU}, which differs from the canonical Te ˜ r-3/4. We calculate the expected spectral energy distribution for the disk and show that this temperature profile produces an infrared excess.

	abstract = {The unusual properties of transition objects (young stars with an optically thin inner disc surrounded by an optically thick outer disc) suggest that significant disc evolution has occurred in these systems. We explore the nature of these systems by examining their demographics, specifically their stellar accretion rates and disc masses Mdisc compared to those of accreting T Tauri stars of comparable age. We find that the transition objects in Taurus occupy a restricted region of the versus Mdisc plane. Compared to non-transition single stars in Taurus, they have stellar accretion rates that are typically {\textasciitilde}10 times lower at the same disc mass and median disc masses approximately four times larger. These properties are anticipated by several proposed planet formation theories and suggest that the formation of Jovian mass planets may play a significant role in explaining the origin of at least some transition objects. Considering transition objects as a distinct demographic group among accreting T Tauri stars leads to a tighter relationship between disc masses and stellar accretion rates, with a slope between the two quantities that is close to the value of unity expected in simple theories of disc accretion.},

	url = {http://ads.nao.ac.jp/abs/2010MNRAS.409..639N},
	abstract = {Angular momentum transport and accretion in protoplanetary discs are generally believed to be driven by magnetohydrodynamics ({MHD)} turbulence via the magnetorotational instability ({MRI).} The dynamics of solid bodies embedded in such discs (dust grains, boulders, planetesimals and planets) may be strongly affected by the turbulence, such that the formation pathways for planetary systems are determined in part by the strength and spatial distribution of the turbulent flow. We examine the dynamics of planetesimals, with radii between 1m and 10km, embedded in turbulent protoplanetary discs, using {3D} {MHD} simulations. The planetesimals experience gas drag and stochastic gravitational forces due to the turbulent disc. We use, and compare the results from, local shearing box simulations and global models in this study. The main aims of this work are to examine: the growth, and possible saturation, of the velocity dispersion of embedded planetesimals as a function of their size and disc parameters; the rate of radial migration and diffusion of planetesimals; the conditions under which the results from shearing box and global simulations agree. We find good agreement between local and global simulations when shearing boxes of dimension {4H} × {16H} × {2H} are used (H being the local scaleheight). The magnitude of the density fluctuations obtained is sensitive to the box size, due to the excitation and propagation of spiral density waves. This affects the stochastic forcing experienced by planetesimals. The correlation time associated with the stochastic forcing is also found to be a function of the box size and aspect ratio. The equilibrium radial velocity dispersion, σ(vr), obtained depends on the radii, Rp, of the planetesimals. Bodies with Rp = 50m achieve the smallest value with σ(vr) {\textasciitilde}= 20ms-1. Smaller bodies are tightly coupled to the gas, and boulders with Rp = 1m attain a value of σ(vr) similar to the turbulent velocity of the gas ({\textasciitilde}100ms-1). Equilibrium values of σ(vr) for bodies larger than 100m are not achieved in our simulations, but in all models we find rapid growth of the velocity dispersion for planetesimals of size 1 and 10km, such that σ(vr) {\textgreater}= 160ms-1 after a run time of 1200 orbits at a distance of 5au from the central star. These values are too large to allow for the runaway growth of planetesimals, and mutual collisions would lead to catastrophic disruption. Radial migration due to gas drag is observed for bodies with Rp {\textasciitilde}= 1m, and is only modestly affected by the turbulence. Larger bodies undergo a random walk in their semimajor axes, leading to radial diffusion through the disc. For our fiducial disc model, we estimate that radial diffusion across a distance of {\textasciitilde}=2.5au would occur for typical planetesimals in a swarm located at 5au over a disc lifetime of {5Myr.} Radial diffusion of this magnitude appears to be inconsistent with Solar system constraints. Our models show that fully developed magnetohydrodynamics ({MHD)} turbulence in protoplanetary discs would have a destructive effect on embedded planetesimals. Relatively low levels of turbulence are required for traditional models of planetesimal accretion to operate, this being consistent with the existence of a dead zone in protoplanetary discs.},

	abstract = {In general Evolutionary Computation ({EC)} includes a number of optimization methods inspired by biological mechanisms of evolution. The methods catalogued in this area use the Darwinian principles of life evolution to produce algorithms that returns high quality solutions to hard-to-solve optimization problems. The main strength of {EC} is precisely that they provide good solutions even if the computational resources (e.g., running time) are limited. Astronomy and Astrophysics are two fields that often require optimizing problems of high complexity or analyzing a huge amount of data and the so-called complete optimization methods are inherently limited by the size of the problem/data. For instance, reliable analysis of large amounts of data is central to modern astrophysics and astronomical sciences in general. {EC} techniques perform well where other optimization methods are inherently limited (as complete methods applied to {NP-hard} problems), and in the last ten years, numerous proposals have come up that apply with greater or lesser success methodologies of evolutional computation to common engineering problems. Some of these problems, such as the estimation of non-lineal parameters, the development of automatic learning techniques, the implementation of control systems, or the resolution of multi-objective optimization problems, have had (and have) a special repercussion in the fields. For these reasons {EC} emerges as a feasible alternative for traditional methods. In this paper, we discuss some promising applications in this direction and a number of recent works in this area; the paper also includes a general description of {EC} to provide a global perspective to the reader and gives some guidelines of application of {EC} techniques for future research},

	abstract = {The formation of giant planets requires accumulation of {\textasciitilde}10 Earth mass in solids; but how do protoplanets acquire their mass? There are many, often competing processes that regulate the accretion rate of protoplanets. To assess their effects we present a new, publicly-available toy model. The rationale behind the toy model is that it encompasses as many physically-relevant processes as possible, but at the same time does not compromise its simplicity, speed, and physical insight. The toy model follows a modular structure, where key features -- e.g. planetesimal fragmentation, radial orbital decay, nebula turbulence -- can be switched on or off. Our model assumes three discrete components (fragments, planetesimals, and embryos) and is zero dimensional in space. We have tested the outcomes of the toy model against literature results and generally find satisfactory agreement. We include, for the first time, model features that capture the three-way interactions among small particles, gas, and protoplanets. Collisions among planetesimals will result in fragmentation, transferring a substantial amount of the solid mass to small particles, which couple strongly to the gas. Our results indicate that the efficiency of the accretion process then becomes very sensitive to the gas properties -- especially to the turbulent state and the magnitude of the disk headwind (the decrease of the orbital velocity of the gas with respect to Keplerian) -- as well as to the characteristic fragment size.},

The formulation is based on the master difference equation for population balance and the number and energy balance considerations, allowing the charge to be only an integral multiple (positive or negative) of the electronic charge. The kinetics for (i) dark complex plasmas where accretion of electrons/ionic species are the dominant charging mechanisms and (ii) illuminated complex plasmas where photoemission significantly contributes to dust charging has been developed. The expression for the mean energy associated with the accretion of ionic species over dust gains in meso-thermal flow of complex plasmas has been derived and employed to obtain the charge distribution and other relevant plasma parameters. The high speed of meso-thermal flow of the plasma influences the dust charging towards more positive character and leads to significant reduction in electron and ion densities, even in the presence of photoemission from dust grains.},

We construct models of the photoevaporative wind produced by the direct field, first using simple analytic arguments and later using detailed numerical hydrodynamics. We find that the wind produced by the direct field at late times is much larger than has previously been assumed, and we show that the mass-loss rate scales as R1/2in (where Rin is the radius of the instantaneous inner disc edge). We suggest that this result has important consequences for theories of disc evolution, and go on to consider the effects of this result on disc evolution in detail in a companion paper.},

angular momentum transport processes. One of the most promising 
processes is {MHD} turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability 
({MRI).} The nonlinear regime of the {MRI} has been well studied in ideal 
{MHD} using numerical simulations. However, in some astrophysical systems, 
accretion disks are expected to be only partially ionized, in which case 
non-ideal {MHD} effects must be considered. In circumstellar 
(protoplanetary) disks around young stars and in dwarf nova disks in 
quiescence, the Hall effect and ohmic dissipation are important. 
Recently, linear analyses of the {MRI} in the Hall regime has been 
presented by Wardle (1999) and Balbus \& Terquem (2001). The maximum 
growth rate and characteristic wavelength of the {MRI} are strongly 
modified by the Hall effect. Most interesting is that the linear 
properties of the instability depend on the direction of magnetic field. 
We investigate the effect of the Hall term on the nonlinear evolution of 
the {MRI} using {3D} non-ideal {MHD} simulations. The local shearing box 
approximation is used for the calculations. The characteristics of the 
saturated turbulent state, which determines the accretion rate, are 
found to depend on the efficiency of the Hall term and ohmic 
dissipation. We discus the conditions for significant accretion rate in 
weakly ionized disks and apply the results to the evolutionary scenarios 
for protoplanetary and dwarf nova disks.},

Although this provides improvements compared with evaluating all terms in the same manner, sources with positive values, in particular, often cause code reliability issues.

The method is verified by a combination of stability analyses followed by computational experiments to validate the stability findings in meaningful problems.

initial structures and study their head-on collisions with the use of 
realistic binding forces. Our numerical results indicate that the energy 
criteria for compression and disruption of {BCCA} clusters are consistent 
with previous two-dimensional simulations. For aggregate compression at 
a collision, we succeed in obtaining a scaling law in which the gyration 
radius of the resultant aggregate is proportional to 
E-0.10imp, where Eimp is the impact 
energy. Furthermore, we derive an ``equation of state'' of aggregates 
which reproduces the scaling law for compression. The equation of state 
is useful for describing the density evolution of dust aggregates during 
their growth.},

	abstract = {We develop a fast and accurate calculation method for ionization degrees in protoplanetary and circumplanetary disks including dust grains. We apply our method to calculate the ionization degree of circumplanetary disks. It is important to understand the structure and evolution of protoplanetary /circumplanetary disks since they are thought to be the sites of planet/satellite formation. The turbulence that causes gas accretion is supposed to be driven by magnetorotational instability ({MRI)} that occurs only when the ionization degree is high enough for magnetic field to be coupled to gas. We calculate the ionization degrees in circumplanetary disks to estimate the sizes of {MRI-inactive} regions. We properly include the effect of dust grains because they efficiently capture charged particles and make ionization degree lower. Inclusion of dust grains complicates the reaction equations and requires expensive computation. In order to accelerate the calculation of ionization reactions, we develop a semianalytic method based on the charge distribution model proposed previously. This method enables us to study the ionization state of disks for a wide range of model parameters. For a previous model of circum-Jovian disk, we find that an {MRI-inactive} region covers almost all regions even without dust grains. This suggests that the gas accretion rates in circumplanetary disks are much smaller than previously thought.},

We investigate how accurately the distance to the source and the masses and spins of the two bodies will be measured from the inspiral gravitational wave signals by the three-detector {LIGO-VIRGO} network using ‘‘advanced detectors’’ (those present a few years after initial operation). The large number of cycles in the observable waveform increases our sensitivity to those parameters that affect the inspiral rate, and thereby the evolution of the waveform’s phase. These parameters are thus measured much more accurately than parameters which affect the waveform’s polarization or amplitude. To lowest order in a post-Newtonian expansion, the evolution of the waveform’s phase depends only on the combination {scrM≡(M1M2)3/5(M1+M2)-1/5} of the masses M1 and M2 of the two bodies, which is known as the ‘‘chirp mass.’’ To post-1-Newtonian order, the waveform’s phase also depends sensitively on the binary’s reduced mass {μ≡M1M2/(M1+M2)} allowing, in principle, a measurement of both M1 and M2 with high accuracy.},

	abstract = {The thermal and chemical evolution of star-forming clouds is studied for different gas metallicities, Z, using the model of Omukai, updated to include deuterium chemistry and the effects of cosmic microwave background ({CMB)} radiation. {HD-line} cooling dominates the thermal balance of clouds when Z {\textasciitilde} 10-5 to 10-3 Z☉ and density ≈105 cm-3. Early on, {CMB} radiation prevents the gas temperature from falling below {TCMB}, although this hardly alters the cloud thermal evolution in low-metallicity gas. From the derived temperature evolution, we assess cloud/core fragmentation as a function of metallicity from linear perturbation theory, which requires that the core elongation ≡ (b - a)/a {\textgreater} {NL} {\textasciitilde} 1, where a (b) is the short (long) core axis length. The fragment mass is given by the thermal Jeans mass at = {NL.} Given these assumptions and the initial (Gaussian) distribution of , we compute the fragment mass distribution as a function of metallicity. We find that (1) for Z = 0, all fragments are very massive, 103 M☉, consistent with previous studies; (2) for Z {\textgreater} 10-6 Z☉ a few clumps go through an additional high-density (1010 cm-3) fragmentation phase driven by dust cooling, leading to low-mass fragments; (3) the mass fraction in low-mass fragments is initially very small, but at Z {\textasciitilde} 10-5 Z☉ it becomes dominant and continues to grow as Z is increased; (4) as a result of the two fragmentation modes, a bimodal mass distribution emerges in 0.01 {\textless} {Z/Z☉} {\textless} 0.1; and (5) for 0.1 Z☉, the two peaks merge into a single-peaked mass function, which might be regarded as the precursor of the ordinary Salpeter-like initial mass function.},

				Although {MPI} is a de-facto standard for parallel programming on distributed memory systems, writing {MPI} programs is often a time-consuming and complicated process. {XcalableMP} is a language extension of C and Frotran for parallel programming on distributed memory systems that helps users to reduce those programming efforts. {XcalableMP} provides two programming models. The first one is the global view model, which supports typical parallelization based on the data and task parallel paradigm, and enables parallelizing the original sequential code using minimal modification with simple, {OpenMP-like} directives. The other one is the local view model, which allows to use {CAF-like} expression to describe internode communications. Users can even use {MPI} and {OpenMP} explicitly in our language to optimize the performance explicitly. In this paper, we introduce {XcalableMP}, the implementation of the compiler, and the performance evaluation result by global view parallelization in {XcalableMP.} For the performance evaluation, we parallelized {HPC} Challenge Benchmark in {XcalableMP.} It shows that users can describe the parallelization for distributed memory system with a small modification to the original sequential code.},

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ApJ...571..413S},
	abstract = {We present global three-dimensional {MHD} simulations of geometrically thin but unstratified accretion disks in which a near-Keplerian disk rotates between two bounding regions with initial rotation profiles that are stable to the magnetorotational instability ({MRI).} The inner region models the boundary layer between the disk and an assumed more slowly rotating central, nonmagnetic star. We investigate the dynamical evolution of this system in response to initial vertical and toroidal fields imposed in a variety of domains contained within the near-Keplerian disk. Cases with both nonzero and zero net magnetic flux are considered, and sustained dynamo activity is found in runs for up to 50 orbital periods at the outer boundary of the near-Keplerian disk. We find a progression of behavior regarding the turbulence resulting from the {MRI} and the evolving structure of the disk and boundary layer according to the initial field configuration. Simulations starting from fields with small radial scale and with zero net flux lead to the lowest levels of turbulence and smoothest variation of disk mean state variables. As found in local simulations, the final outcome is shown to be independent of the form of the imposed field. For our computational setup, average values of the Shakura \& Sunyaev α-parameter in the Keplerian disk are typically 0.004+/-0.002. The magnetic field eventually always diffuses into the boundary layer, resulting in the buildup of toroidal field, inward angular momentum transport, and the accretion of disk material. The mean radial velocity, while exhibiting large temporal fluctuations, is always subsonic. Simulations starting with net toroidal flux may yield an average α{\textasciitilde}0.04. While being characterized by 1 order of magnitude larger average α, simulations starting from vertical fields with large radial scale and net flux may lead to the formation of persistent nonhomogeneous, nonaxisymmetric magnetically dominated regions of very low density. In these gaps, angular momentum transport occurs through magnetic torques acting between regions on either side of the gap. Local turbulent transport occurs where the magnetic field is not dominant. These simulations are indicative of the behavior of the disk when threaded by magnetic flux originating from an external source. However, the influence of such presumed sources in determining the boundary conditions that should be applied to the disk remains to be investigated.},

We use {JHKL} colors to obtain a census of the circumstellar disk fractions in each cluster. We find disk fractions of 52\%+/-10\%, 12\%+/-4\%, and 3\%+/-3\% for the three clusters, respectively. Together with our previously published {JHKL} investigations of the younger {NGC} 2024, Trapezium, and {IC} 348 clusters, we have completed the first systematic and homogeneous survey for circumstellar disks in a sample of young clusters that both span a significant range in age (0.3-30 Myr) and contain statistically significant numbers of stars whose masses span nearly the entire stellar mass spectrum. Analysis of the combined survey indicates that the cluster disk fraction is initially very high ({\textgreater}=80\%) and rapidly decreases with increasing cluster age, such that one-half the stars within the clusters lose their disks in {\textless}{\textasciitilde}3 Myr. Moreover, these observations yield an overall disk lifetime of {\textasciitilde}6 Myr in the surveyed cluster sample. This is the timescale for essentially all the stars in a cluster to lose their disks. This should set a meaningful constraint for the planet-building timescale in stellar clusters. The implications of these results for current theories of planet formation are briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {The most energetic phenomena in the universe are systems powered by 
gravity through accretion into black holes.  Numerical simulations 
provide a way to investigate the dynamics of these accretion flows 
directly with far fewer limitations compared to analytic models. Because 
magnetic fields are fundamentally important for jets and disks, and 
because we now know that magnetic turbulence accounts for the internal 
stress, the governing equations are those of compressible 
magnetohydrodynamics ({MHD).} Accretion disk dynamics can thus be 
investigated using three-dimensional general relativistic {MHD} simulation 
codes.  Although it is not yet possible to do fully global time 
dependent radiation transport in disk models, the observational 
implications of these simulations can be investigated using simple 
emission and absorption models coupled with relativistic ray tracing. 
The time and length-scales involved make such simulations challenging, 
but results to date have revealed details about time-dependent 
properties of disks, magnetic disk dynamos, jet launching mechanisms, 
and the dynamical properties of systems other than the standard thin 
disk. As the capabilities of computational hardware increase, and the 
development of advanced numerical codes continues, our theoretical 
understanding of accretion physics will substantially increase.},

	abstract = {We carry out radiation hydrodynamic calculations to study physical processes in the formation of a 1 M☉ protostar. Following our previous work, calculations pursue the whole evolution from the beginning of the first collapse to the end of the main accretion phase. The adiabatic core formed after the initial collapse (i.e., the first core) experiences further gravitational collapse triggered by dissociation of molecular hydrogen, which leads to the formation of the second core, i.e., the birth of a protostar. The protostar grows in mass as accreting the infalling material from the circumstellar envelope, while the protostar keeps its radius at {\textasciitilde}4 R☉ during the main accretion phase. These typical features in the evolution are in good agreement with previous studies. We consider two different initial conditions for the density distribution: homogeneous and hydrostatic cloud cores with the same central density of 1.415 × 10-19 g cm-3 . The homogeneous core has the total mass of 1 M☉ while the hydrostatic core has 3.852 M☉. For the initially homogeneous model, the accretion luminosity rapidly rises to the maximum value of 25 L☉ just after the birth of a protostar, and declines gradually as the mass accretion rate decreases. In contrast, the luminosity increases monotonically with time for the initially hydrostatic model. This difference arises because the mass accretion rate varies depending on the inward acceleration at the initial stage, which affects the luminosity curve. A less massive hydrostatic core would possess the similar properties in the luminosity curve to the 3.852 M☉ case, because a hydrostatic cloud core with mass lower than 3.852 M☉ can be shown to provide a smaller mass accretion rate after the birth of a protostar and a more gradual rise in the luminosity curve. Our numerical code is designed to provide the evolution of the spectral energy distribution ({SED)} along with the dynamical evolution in our spherically symmetric calculations. We confirm that the {SED} evolves from a 10 K graybody spectrum to hotter spectra typical for class I and flat spectrum sources. The {SED} for the class 0 sources corresponds to the age of 2 × 104 yr, which is smaller by an order of magnitude than the typical age of class I objects. Considering possible nonspherically symmetric effects, we suggest that observed class 0 sources should consist of the},

Our main result is the reduction of the fragment assembly to a variation of the classical Eulerian path problem that allows one to generate accurate solutions of large-scale sequencing problems. euler, in contrast to the celera assembler, does not mask such repeats but uses them instead as a powerful fragment assembly tool.},

Methods: We use coagulation/fragmentation and disk-structure models, to simulate the evolution of dust in a bumpy surface density profile, which we mimic with a sinusoidal disturbance. For different values of the amplitude and length scale of the bumps, we investigate the ability of this model to produce and retain large particles on million-year timescales. In addition, we compare the pressure inhomogeneities considered in this work with the pressure profiles that come from magnetorotational instability. Using the Common Astronomy Software Applications {ALMA} simulator, we study whether there are observational signatures of these pressure inhomogeneities that can be seen with {ALMA.}
Results: We present the conditions required to trap dust particles and the corresponding calculations predicting the spectral slope in the mm-wavelength range, to compare with current observations. Finally, we present simulated images using different antenna configurations of {ALMA} at different frequencies, to show that the ring structures will be detectable at the distances of either the Taurus Auriga or Ophiucus star-forming regions.},

physics of potential angular momentum transport processes-including 
self-gravity, magnetorotational instability, baroclinic instabilities, 
and magnetic braking-and in developing testable models for disk 
dispersal via photoevaporation. The relative importance of these 
processes depends upon the initial mass, size, and magnetization of the 
disk, and subsequently on its opacity, ionization state, and external 
irradiation. Disk dynamics is therefore coupled to star formation, 
pre-main-sequence stellar evolution, and dust coagulation during the 
early stages of planet formation and may vary dramatically from star to 
star. The importance of validating theoretical models is emphasized, 
with the key observations being those that probe disk structure on the

We develop two complementary techniques for deriving the two dimensional planet intensity: regularized slice mapping and spherical harmonic mapping. Both techniques give similar derived intensity maps for the infrared day-side flux of the planet, while the spherical harmonic method can be extended to include phase variation data which better constrain the map. The longitudinal offset of the day-side hot spot is consistent with that found in prior studies, strengthening the claim of super-rotating winds, and eliminating the possibility of phase variations being caused by stellar variability. The latitude of the hot-spot is within 12.5 deg (68\% confidence) of the planet's equator, confirming the predictions of general circulation models for hot Jupiters and indicative of a small planet obliquity.},

The angle-dependent and frequency-dependent radiative transfer equation is solved without any diffusion approximations, and the evolution of the spectral energy distribution ({SED)} is examined. In the present paper, as the first step in a series of our work, evolutions before hydrogen molecules begin to dissociate (the so-called first collapse) are examined for different masses and initial temperatures of the parent cloud cores and for different opacities. Numerical results for a typical case [Tinit = 10 K and {κP(10} K) {\textasciitilde} 0.01 cm2 g-1] show that the radius and mass of the first core are {\textasciitilde}5 {AU} and {\textasciitilde}0.05 M☉, respectively. These values are independent both of the mass of the parent cloud core and of the initial density profile. The analytical expressions for the radius, mass, and accretion luminosity of the first core are also obtained. The {SED} contains only cold components of a few times 10 K throughout the first collapse phase, because the opaque envelope veils the first core from observers. We suggest that the molecular cloud cores with luminosities higher than {\textasciitilde}0.1 L☉ should contain young protostars deep in the center, even if they show no evidence for the existence of central stars in near-infrared and optical observations.},

	abstract = {Porosity evolution of dust aggregates is crucial in understanding dust evolution in protoplanetary disks. In this study, we present useful tools to study the coagulation and porosity evolution of dust aggregates. First, we present a new numerical method for simulating dust coagulation and porosity evolution as an extension of the conventional Smoluchowski equation. This method follows the evolution of the mean porosity for each aggregate mass simultaneously with the evolution of the mass distribution function. This method reproduces the results of previous Monte Carlo simulations with much less computational expense. Second, we propose a new collision model for porous dust aggregates on the basis of our N-body experiments on aggregate collisions. As the first step, we focus on "hit-and-stick" collisions, which involve neither compression nor fragmentation of aggregates. We first obtain empirical data on porosity changes between the classical limits of ballistic cluster-cluster and particle-cluster aggregation. Using the data, we construct a recipe for the porosity change due to general hit-and-stick collisions as well as formulae for the aerodynamical and collisional cross sections. Our collision model is thus more realistic than a previous model of Ormel et al. based on the classical aggregation limits only. Simple coagulation simulations using the extended Smoluchowski method show that our collision model explains the fractal dimensions of porous aggregates observed in a full N-body simulation and a laboratory experiment. By contrast, similar simulations using the collision model of Ormel et al. result in much less porous aggregates, meaning that this model underestimates the porosity increase upon unequal-sized collisions. Besides, we discover that aggregates at the high-mass end of the distribution can have a considerably small aerodynamical cross section per unit mass compared with aggregates of lower masses. This occurs when aggregates drift under uniform acceleration (e.g., gravity) and their collision is induced by the difference in their terminal velocities. We point out an important implication of this discovery for dust growth in protoplanetary disks.},

	abstract = {The saturation level of the magnetorotational instability ({MRI)} is investigated using three-dimensional {MHD} simulations. The shearing box approximation is adopted and the vertical component of gravity is ignored, so that the evolution of the {MRI} is followed in a small local part of the disk. We focus on the dependence of the saturation level of the stress on the gas pressure, which is a key assumption in the standard α disk model. From our numerical experiments we find that there is a weak power-law relation between the saturation level of the Maxwell stress and the gas pressure in the nonlinear regime; the higher the gas pressure, the larger the stress. Although the power-law index depends slightly on the initial field geometry, the relationship between stress and gas pressure is independent of the initial field strength and is unaffected by ohmic dissipation if the magnetic Reynolds number is at least 10. The relationship is the same in adiabatic calculations, where pressure increases over time, and nearly isothermal calculations, where pressure varies little with time. Over the entire region of parameter space explored, turbulence driven by the {MRI} has many characteristic ratios such as that of the Maxwell stress to the magnetic pressure. We also find that the amplitudes of the spatial fluctuations in density and the time variability in the stress are characterized by the ratio of magnetic pressure to gas pressure in the nonlinear regime. Our numerical results are qualitatively consistent with an idea that the saturation level of the {MRI} is determined by a balance between the growth of the {MRI} and the dissipation of the field through reconnection. The quantitative interpretation of the pressure-stress relation, however, may require advances in the theoretical understanding of nonsteady magnetic reconnection.},

	abstract = {We use a global magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a geometrically thin accretion disc to investigate the locality and detailed structure of turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability ({MRI).} The model disc has an aspect ratio {H/R≃} 0.07, and is computed using a higher order Godunov magnetohydrodynamics ({MHD)} scheme with accurate fluxes. We focus the analysis on late times after the system has lost direct memory of its initial magnetic flux state. The disc enters a saturated turbulent state in which the fastest growing modes of the {MRI} are well resolved, with a relatively high efficiency of angular momentum transport {\textless}{\textless}α{\textgreater}{\textgreater}≈ 2.5 × 10-2. The accretion stress peaks at the disc mid-plane, above and below which exists a moderately magnetized corona with patches of superthermal field. By analysing the spatial and temporal correlations of the turbulent fields, we find that the spatial structure of the magnetic and kinetic energy is moderately well localized (with correlation lengths along the major axis of {2.5H} and {1.5H}, respectively), and generally consistent with that expected of homogeneous incompressible turbulence. The density field, conversely, exhibits both a longer correlation length and a long correlation time, results that we ascribe to the importance of spiral density waves within the flow. Consistent with prior results, we show that the mean local stress displays a well-defined correlation with the local vertical flux, and that this relation is apparently causal (in the sense of the flux stimulating the stress) during portions of a global dynamo cycle. We argue that the observed flux-stress relation supports dynamo models in which the structure of coronal magnetic fields plays a central role in determining the dynamics of thin-disc accretion.},

	abstract = {We present the study of the flow of a dust particle by a weakly ionized 
highly collisional drifting plasma. The charging of a conductive sphere 
and wake formation downstream and upstream of it is analyzed in the case 
of a strong external field l0 = E0 /(4πen0 ) {λD} a (E0 is the 
magnitude of the external field, n0 is plasma density, {λD} is 
Debye length and a is a radius of the sphere). Under such conditions, 
the effects of the space charge field and ionization-recombination 
processes play crucial role. The sphere charge and the spatial 
distributions of plasma ions and electrons are calculated nu-merically; 
analytical expressions are obtained for some limiting cases. We obtain 
that the size of the wake is determined by the external field and the 
recombination rate. At low recombination rates (α/(4πµ+,- 
) 1, where α is the recombination coefficient, µ+,- are 
mobilities of positive and negative plasma particles) the longitudinal 
scale of wake is about 20l0 , at high recombina-tion rates the 
longitudinal scale is about l0 . The transverse scale of the wake is 
determined by the ratio of the mobilities and can reach several dust 
particle radii. It was also shown that the absolute value of the dust 
particle charge decreases with increasing recombination rate. The total 
electric charge (the sphere charge plus the plasma space charge) is 
shown to be zero in accordance with predictions of the theory of static 
currents in a conducting medium. On the basis of the obtained spatial 
distributions of charged plasma particles, the electrostatic potential 
around the sphere is calculated numerically. The interaction potential 
between two systems "particle+wake" is analyzed for arbitrary locations 
of such systems. We obtain that the potential can be attractive at 
moderate and large distances, if the particles are not aligned in the 
direction perpendicular to the external electric field. The results can 
be important in understanding intergrain interactions in weakly ionized 
highly collisional anisotropic dusty plasmas.},

We use waveform libraries provided by the latest numerical simulations of rotating stellar core collapse models in general relativity, and from them create an orthogonal set of eigenvectors using principal component analysis. Bayesian inference techniques are then used to reconstruct the associated gravitational wave signal that is assumed to be detected by an interferometric detector. Posterior probability distribution functions are derived for the amplitudes of the principal component analysis eigenvectors, and the pulse arrival time. We show how the reconstructed signal and the principal component analysis eigenvector amplitude estimates may provide information on the physical parameters associated with the core collapse event.},

nonaxisymmetric perturbations in weakly magnetized disks is presented. 
Such disturbances are of interest for several reasons, most notably in 
the context of a dynamo magnetic field amplification scheme. The most 
volatile disturbances are those associated with the presence of a 
poloidal field, which grow by tens of orders of magnitude with e-folding 
times measured in fractions of an orbital period. We also examine the 
stability of a purely azimuthal field configuration and find that 
nonaxisymmetric instability is present, but with a growth time measured 
in tens of orbital periods. In general, the most rapid growth occurs for 
very small radial and azimuthal wavenumbers, leading to coherent 
magnetic field structure in planes parallel to the disk. We suggest that 
this instability will prove to be a key ingredient for the generation of 
magnetic fields in disks.},

black hole are large enough, the vacuum surrounding the hole is unstable 
because any stray charged particles will be electrostatically 
accelerated and will radiate, with the radiation producing 
electron-positron pairs so freely that the electromagnetic field in the 
vicinity of the event horizon will become approximately force-free. 
Equations governing stationary force-free electromagnetic fields in Kerr 
spacetime are derived, and it is found that energy and angular momentum 
can be extracted from a rotating black hole by a purely electromagnetic 
mechanism. A perturbation technique is outlined for calculating 
approximate solutions under certain circumstances, and solutions are 
obtained for a split monopole magnetic field as well as for a 
paraboloidal magnetic field. The present concepts are applied to a model

To enable such automatic translations, we design a small set of declarative constructs that allow the user to express stencil computations in a portable and implicitly parallel manner. Our framework translates the user-written code into actual implementation code in {CUDA} for {GPU} acceleration and {MPI} for node-level parallelization with automatic optimizations such as computation and communication overlapping. We demonstrate the feasibility of such automatic translations by implementing several structured grid applications in our framework. Experimental results on the {TSUBAME2.0} {GPU-based} supercomputer show that the performance is comparable as hand-written code and good strong and weak scalability up to 256 {GPUs.}},

decay of radionuclides as ionization sources, and by solving a 
simplified chemical network which includes the effect of the absorption 
of free charges by μm-sized dust grains. In the region where the 
ionization is too low to ensure good coupling between matter and 
magnetic fields, a non-turbulent central 'dead zone' forms, which ranges 
approximately from a distance of 2 to 4 au from the central star. The

We present a scenario to circumvent these two hurdles. Our dust evolution model involves two main mechanisms. First, we consider a disk with a dead zone. In an almost laminar region close to the midplane, the relative velocities of the turbulent particles are comparatively small, which decreases the probability of destructive particle collisions. Second, turbulence is not the only source of violent relative particle velocities, because high radial drift speeds can also lead to boulder fragmentation. For this reason, we focus additionally on the snow line. Evaporation fronts can be associated with gas pressure maxima in which radial drift basically vanishes. This implies that particle fragmentation becomes even less likely. Our simulation results suggest that particles can overcome the fragmentation barrier. We find that boulders of several 102 m can form within only a few thousand years.},

	abstract = {We present fully three-dimensional local simulations of compressible magneto-rotational instability ({MRI)} turbulence with the object of studying and elucidating the excitation of the non-axisymmetric spiral density waves that are observed to always be present in such simulations. They are potentially important for affecting protoplanetary migration through the action of associated stochastic gravitational forces and producing residual transport in {MHD} inactive regions through which they may propagate. The simulations we perform are with zero net flux and produce mean activity levels corresponding to the Shakura \& Syunyaev α {\textasciitilde} 5 × 10-3, being at the lower end of the range usually considered in accretion disc modelling. We reveal the nature of the mechanism responsible for the excitation of these waves by determining the time-dependent evolution of the Fourier transforms of the participating state variables. The dominant waves are found to have no vertical structure and to be excited during periodically repeating swings in which they change from leading to trailing. The initial phase of the evolution of such a swing is found to be in excellent agreement with that expected from the {WKBJ} theory developed in a preceding paper by Heinemann \& Papaloizou. However, shortly after the attainment of the expected maximum wave amplitude, the waves begin to be damped on account of the formation of weak shocks. As expected from the theory, the waves are seen to shorten in radial wavelength as they propagate. This feature enables non-linear dissipation to continue in spite of amplitude decrease. As a consequence, the waves are almost always seen to be in the non-linear regime. We demonstrate that the important source terms causing excitation of the waves are related to a quantity that reduces to the potential vorticity for small perturbations from the background state with no vertical dependence. We find that the root mean square density fluctuations associated with the waves are positively correlated with both this quantity and the general level of hydromagnetic turbulence. The mean angular momentum transport associated with spiral density waves generated in our simulations is estimated to be a significant fraction of that associated with the turbulent Reynolds stress.},

	abstract = {The process that melted and formed the chondrules, millimeter-sized glassy beads within meteorites, has not been conclusively identified. Origin by lightning in the solar nebula is consistent with many features of chondrules, but no viable model of lightning has yet been advanced. We present a model demonstrating how lightning could be generated in the solar nebula which differs from previous models in two important aspects. First, we identify a new, powerful charging mechanism that is based on the differences in contact potentials between particles of different composition, a form of triboelectric charging. In the presence of fine silicate grains and fine iron metal grains, large silicate particles (the chondrules) can acquire charges {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}+105e. Second, we assume that the chondrule precursor particles are selectively concentrated in clumps {\textasciitilde}100 km in size by the turbulent concentration mechanism described by J. N. Cuzzi et al. (1996, in Chondrules and the Protoplanetary Disk, pp. 35-43, Cambridge Univ. Press). The concentration of these highly charged particles into clumps, in a background of negatively charged metal grains, is what generates the strong electric fields. We calculate that electric fields large enough to trigger breakdown easily could have existed over regions large enough ({\textasciitilde}100 km) to generate very large discharges of electrical energy ({\textasciitilde}1016 erg), assuming a lightning bolt width {\textless}{\textasciitilde}10 electron mean-free paths. The discharges would have been sufficiently energetic to have formed the chondrules. We place constraints on the generation of lightning and conclude that it could not be generated if the abundance of {26Al} in chondrules was as high as the level in the calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions ({CAIs).} This conclusion is consistent with isotopic analyses of chondrules. This possibly implies that {26Al} was nonuniformly distributed in the solar nebula or that the chondrules formed several million years after the {CAIs.}},

The size, mass, and radiative properties of protostellar disks are determined by the distribution of mass and angular momentum in the clouds from which they are formed, as well as from the dissipative processes within the disks themselves. The angular momentum of the infalling cloud is redistributed by the action of turbulent viscosity on a shear layer near the surface of the disk (downstream of the accretion shock) and on the radial shear across cylindrical surfaces parallel to the rotation axis. The fraction of gas that is fed into a central core (protostar) during accretion depends on the ratio of the rate of viscous diffusion of angular momentum to the accretion rate; rapid viscous diffusion (or a low accretion rate) promotes a large core-to-disk mass ratio. The continuum radiation spectrum of a highly viscous disk is similar to that of a steady-state accretion disk without mass addition. It is possible to construct models of the primitive solar nebula as an accretion disk, formed by the collapse of a slowly rotating protostellar cloud, and containing the minimum mass required to account for the planets. Other models with more massive disks are also possible.},

The accretion of electrons/ions and the emission of electrons by the dust particles, the ionization of neutral particles and the recombination of electrons and ions, and binary collisions between electrons, ions, and neutral atoms are the processes considered herein; the energy exchange associated with these processes has also been considered. The formulation is applicable to dusty plasmas in space and laboratory, where the photoemission of electrons is the dominant mechanism for electron generation. As an illustration a parametric study of the charging of the dust of Cs (cesium) coated bronze, {LaB6}, and {CeO2}, illuminated by solar radiation in a plasma environment, characteristic of day time ionosphere at an altitude of 150 km has been made. The theory is valid when the mean free path of electrons for accretion by the dust particles is less than the dimensions of the dust clouds.},

However, in a companion paper we have shown that at late times such models must consider the effect of stellar radiation directly incident on the inner disc edge, and here we model the observational implications of this process. We find that the entire disc is dispersed on a time-scale of the order of 105 yr after a disc lifetime of a few Myr, consistent with observations of T Tauri ({TT)} stars. We use a simple prescription to model the spectral energy distribution of the evolving disc, and demonstrate that the model is consistent with observational data across a wide range of wavelengths. We also note that the model predicts a short `inner hole' phase in the evolution of all {TT} discs, and make predictions for future observations at mid-infrared and millimetre wavelengths.},

	abstract = {We present the first three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic ({MHD)} simulations of a circumbinary disk surrounding an equal mass binary. The binary maintains a fixed circular orbit of separation \$a\$. As in previous hydrodynamical simulations, strong torques by the binary can maintain a gap of radius \${\textbackslash}simeq 2a\$. Streams curve inward from \$r {\textbackslash}simeq 2a\$ toward the binary; some of their mass passes through the inner boundary, while the remainder swings back out to the disk. However, we also find that near its inner edge the disk develops both a strong \$m=1\$ asymmetry and growing orbital eccentricity. Because the {MHD} stresses introduce more matter into the gap, the total torque per unit disk mass is \${\textbackslash}simeq 14\$ times larger than found previously. The inner boundary accretion rate per unit disk mass is \${\textbackslash}simeq 40\$ times greater than found from previous hydrodynamical calculations. The implied binary shrinkage rate is determined by a balance between the rate at which the binary gains angular momentum by accretion and loses it by gravitational torque. The large accretion rate brings these two rates nearly into balance, but in net, we find that \${\textbackslash}dot a/a {\textless} 0\$, and its magnitude is about 2.7 times larger than predicted by the earlier hydrodynamic simulations. If the binary comprises two massive black holes, the accretion rate may be great enough for one or both to be {AGN}, with consequences for the physical state of the gas both in the disk body and in its inner gap.},

with the gas being regarded as cold and starting from rest at the 
equatorial plane, with the disk itself in Keplerian orbit about a black 
hole. It is shown that a centrifugally driven outflow of matter from the 
disk is possible if the poloidal component of the magnetic field makes 
an angle of less than 60 deg with disk surface. At large distances the 
outflow forms a pair of collimated, antiparallel jets, while close to 
the disk it is probably driven by gas pressure in a hot, magnetically 
dominated corona.},

	abstract = {Meteorite magnetic records constitute physical evidence of processes acting during early Solar System evolution. Consequently the validation of these records is important in meteorite research. The first step in the validation process should be the {REM} value. The {REM} value is the ratio of {NRM} (natural remanence) to {SIRM} (saturation remanent magnetization imparted by a 1 Tesla magnetic field). The {REM} values range over 3 {\textasciitilde} 4 orders of magnitude for stony meteorites and for chondrules from Allende({C3V-S1)}, Bjurbole (L4-S1) and Chainpur ({LL3-S1)} meteorites. {REM} values computed from published {NRM} and {SIRM} data, identify many orders of magnitude range in the {REM} values including {REM} values {\textgreater} 100 e-3. These data suggest a dependence for the {NRM} intensity on the curatorial location from which the sample was obtained. Any Earth rock acquiring {TRM} in the geomagnetic field has a restricted range in {REM} mostly between 5 and 50 e-3, the exception being the mineral hematite in the multidomain size range. The only terrestrial samples with {REM} much greater than 100 e-3 are those struck by lightning. The {REM} value provides a physical basis for recognition between valid records and those that "might be contaminated". The isothermal remanence acquisition ({RA)} curve is presented as a contamination curve which allows an indication of the level of magnetic field contamination required to give the computed {"REM"} ({RM/SIRM)} value. In the case of the Bjurbole and Chainpur chondrules, with {REM} values {\textgreater}100 e-3, the {RA} curve indicates that unrealistically large contamination magnetic fields would be required to give {REM} values {\textgreater}100 e-3. This would suggest other than contamination by a hand magnet that is normally available to the experimenter. This would require an explanation that would involve large magnetic fields during chondrule formation, or some extraordinary remanence acquisition mechanism that remains to be described. Magnetic contamination experiments, using {\textasciitilde}80 {mT} and {\textasciitilde}40 {mT} magnets, demonstrate that the {"REM"} values and extent of modification of the magnetic vector record are mineralogy dependent and this is mostly related to the amount and characteristics of the mineral tetrataenite. The complexity of the meteorite records suggest validation of the record as a first step. The {REM} value is the first physical statement that can be made in this validation},

The physics of the interaction between the particles is described by a one-dimensional Riemann problem in a moving frame. As a result, the necessary diffusion which is required to treat dissipative processes is added automatically. Our scheme therefore has no free parameters that control the physics of interparticle interaction, with the exception of the number of interacting neighbours which control the resolution and accuracy. The resulting equations have a form similar to smoothed particle hydrodynamics ({SPH)} equations, and therefore existing {SPH} codes can be used to implement the weighed particle scheme. The scheme is validated in several hydrodynamic and {MHD} test cases. In particular, we demonstrate for the first time the ability of a meshless {MHD} scheme to model magnetorotational instability in accretion discs.},

	abstract = {One of the central goals of the Spitzer Legacy Project {``From} Cores to Disks'' (c2d) is to determine the frequency of circumstellar disks around weak-line T Tauri stars ({WTTSs)} and to study the properties and evolutionary status of these disks. Here we present a census of disks for a sample of over 230 {WTTSs} located in the c2d {IRAC} and {MIPS} maps of the Ophiuchus, Lupus, and Perseus Molecular Clouds. We find that {\textasciitilde}20\% of the {WTTSs} in a magnitude-limited subsample have {IR} excesses at {IRAC} wavelengths. These disks frequencies are {\textasciitilde}3-6 times larger than that recently found for a sample of relatively isolated {WTTSs} located outside the highest extinction regions covered by the c2d maps. The disk fractions we find are more consistent with those obtained in recent Spitzer studies of {WTTSs} in young clusters such as {IC} 348 and Tr 37. According to their location in the H-R diagram, the {WTTSs} with excesses in our sample are among the younger part of the age distribution. Still, up to {\textasciitilde}50\% of the apparently youngest stars in the sample show no evidence of {IR} excess, suggesting that the circumstellar disks of a sizable fraction of pre-main-sequence stars dissipate in a timescale of {\textasciitilde}1 Myr. We also find that none of the stars in our sample apparently older than {\textasciitilde}10 Myr have detectable circumstellar disks at wavelengths {\textless}24 μm. The {WTTS} disks in our sample exhibit a wide range of properties ({SED} morphology, inner radius, {Ldisk/L*}, etc.) that bridge the gaps observed between the {CTTSs} and the debris disk regimes.},

Such waves are generically found to be excited in simulations of turbulent accretion discs, in particular if the said turbulence arises from the magneto-rotational instability ({MRI).} We derive a modified Burgers equation governing their dynamics, which includes the effects of non-linear steepening, dispersion and a bulk viscosity to support shocks. We solve this equation approximately to obtain non-linear sawtooth solutions that are asymptotically valid at late times. In this limit, the presence of shocks is found to cause the wave amplitude to decrease with time as t-2. The validity of the analytic description is confirmed by direct numerical solution of the full non-linear equations of motion. The asymptotic forms of the wave profiles of the state variables are also found to occur in {MRI} simulations, indicating that dissipation due to shocks plays a significant role apart from any effects arising from direct coupling to the turbulence.},

	abstract = {We discuss results of global three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion on to a rotating magnetized star with a tilted dipole magnetic field, where the accretion is driven by the magnetorotational instability ({MRI).} The simulations show that {MRI-driven} turbulence develops in the disc, and angular momentum is transported outwards primarily due to the magnetic stress. The turbulent flow is strongly inhomogeneous and the densest matter is in azimuthally stretched turbulent cells. We investigate two regimes of accretion: a magnetospheric regime and a boundary layer ({BL)} regime. In the magnetospheric regime, the magnetic field of the star is dynamically important: the accretion disc is truncated by the star’s magnetic field within a few stellar radii from the star’s surface, and matter flows to the star in funnel streams. The funnel streams flow towards the south and north magnetic poles but are not equal due to the inhomogeneity of the flow. The hotspots on the stellar surface are not symmetric as well. In the {BL} regime, the magnetic field of the star is dynamically unimportant, and matter accretes on to the surface of the star through the {BL.} The magnetic field in the inner disc is strongly amplified by the shear of the accretion flow, and the matter and magnetic stresses become comparable. Accreting matter forms a belt-shaped hot region on the surface of the star. The belt has inhomogeneous density distribution which varies in time due to variable accretion rate. The peaks in the variability curve are associated with accretion of individual turbulent cells. They show 20–50 per cent density amplifications at periods of ∼5–10 dynamical time-scales at the surface of the star. Spiral waves in the disc are excited in both magnetospheric and {BL} regimes of accretion. Results of simulations can be applied to classical T Tauri stars, accreting brown dwarfs, millisecond pulsars, dwarf novae cataclysmic variables and other stars with magnetospheres smaller than several stellar radii.},

	abstract = {The dynamical foundations of \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ disk models are described. At the heart of the viscous formalism of accretion disk models are correlations in the fluctuating components of the disk velocity, magnetic field, and gravitational potential. We relate these correlations to the large scale mean flow dynamics used in phenomenological viscous disk models. {MHD} turbulence readily lends itself to the \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ formalsim, but transport by self-gravity does not. Nonlocal transport is an intrinsic property of turbulent self-gravitating disks, which in general cannot be captured by an \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ model. Local energy dissipation and \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-like behavior can be re-established if the pattern speeds associated with the amplitudes of an azimuthal Fourier decomposition of the turbulence are everywhere close to the local rotation frequency. In this situation, global wave transport must be absent. Shearing box simulations, which employ boundary conditions forcing local behavior, are probably not an adequate tool for modeling the behavior of self-gravitating disks. As a matter of principle, it is possible that disks which hover near the edge of gravitational stability may behave in accord with a local \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ model, but global simulations performed to date suggest matters are not this simple.},

	abstract = {Close binary systems of compact objects with less than ten minutes remaining before coalescence are readily identifiable sources of gravitational radiation for the United States Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory ({LIGO)} and the French-Italian {VIRGO} gravitational-wave observatory. As a start toward assessing the full capabilities of the {LIGO-VIRGO} detector network, we investigate the sensitivity of individual {LIGO-VIRGO-like} interferometers and the precision with which they can determine the characteristics of an inspiralling binary system. Since the two interferometers of the {LIGO} detector share nearly the same orientation, their joint sensitivity is similar to that of a single, more sensitive interferometer. We express our results for a single interferometer of both initial and advanced {LIGO} design, and also for the {LIGO} detector in the limit that its two interferometers share exactly the same orientation. We approximate the secular evolution of a binary system as driven exclusively by its leading-order quadrupole gravitational radiation. Observations of a binary in a single interferometer are described by four characteristic quantities: an amplitude {scrA}, a chirp mass {scrM}, a time T, and a phase ψ. We find the amplitude signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR)} ρ of an observed binary system as a function of {scrA} and {scrM} for a particular orientation of the binary with respect to the interferometer, and also the distribution of {SNR's} for randomly oriented binaries at a constant distance. To assess the interferometer sensitivity, we calculate the rate at which sources are expected to be observed and the range to which they are observable. Assuming a conservative rate density for coalescing neutron-star binary systems of 8×10-8 yr-1 Mpc-3, we find that the advanced {LIGO} detector will observe approximately 69 yr-1 with an amplitude {SNR} greater than 8. Of these, approximately 7 yr-1 will be from binaries at distances greater than 950 Mpc. We give analytic and numerical results for the precision with which each of the characteristic quantities can be determined by interferometer observations. For neutron-star binaries, the fractional 1σ statistical error in the determination of {scrA} is equal to 1/ρ. For ρ{\textgreater}8, the fractional 1σ error in the measurement of {scrM} in the advanced {LIGO} detectors is less than 2×10-5, a phenomenal precision. The characteristic time is related to the moment when coalescence occurs, and can be measured in the advanced detectors with a 1σ uncertainty of less than 3×10-4 s (assuming ρ{\textgreater}8). We also explore the sensitivity of these results to a tunable parameter in the interferometer design (the recycling frequency). The optimum choice of the parameter is dependent on the goal of the observations, e.g., maximizing the rate of detections or maximizing the precision of measurement. We determine the optimum parameter values for these two cases. The calculations leading to the {SNR} and the precision of measurement assume that the interferometer observations extend over only the last several minutes of binary inspiral, during which time the orbital frequency increases from approximately 5 Hz to 500 Hz. We examine the sensitivity of our results to the elapsed time of the observation and show that observations of longer duration lead to very little improvement in the {SNR} or the precision of measurement.},

	abstract = {The dynamical foundations of alpha disk models are described. At the 
heart of the viscous formalism of accretion disk models are correlations 
in the fluctuating components of the disk velocity, magnetic field, and 
gravitational potential. We relate these correlations to the large-scale 
mean flow dynamics used in phenomenological viscous disk models. {MHD} 
turbulence readily lends itself to the alpha formalism, but transport by 
self-gravity does not. Nonlocal transport is an intrinsic property of 
turbulent self-gravitating disks, which in general cannot be captured by 
an alpha model. Local energy dissipation and alpha-like behavior can be 
reestablished if the pattern speeds associated with the amplitudes of an 
azimuthal Fourier decomposition of the turbulence are everywhere close 
to the local rotation frequency. In this situation, global wave 
transport must be absent. Shearing box simulations, which employ 
boundary conditions forcing local behavior, are probably not an adequate 
tool for modeling the behavior of self-gravitating disks. As a matter of 
principle, it is possible that disks that hover near the edge of 
gravitational stability may behave in accord with a local alpha model, 
but global simulations performed to date suggest matters are not this 
simple.},

	abstract = {Magnetic fields likely play a key role in the dynamics and evolution of 
protoplanetary disks. They have the potential to efficiently transport 
angular momentum by {MHD} turbulence or via the magnetocentrifugal 
acceleration of outflows from the disk surface. Magnetically-driven 
mixing has implications for disk chemistry and evolution of the grain 
population, and the effective viscous response of the disk determines 
whether planets migrate inwards or outwards. However, the weak 
ionisation of protoplanetary disks means that magnetic fields may not be 
able to effectively couple to the matter. I examine the magnetic 
diffusivity in a minimum solar nebula model and present calculations of 
the ionisation equilibrium and magnetic diffusivity as a function of 
height from the disk midplane at radii of 1 and 5 {AU.} Dust grains tend 
to suppress magnetic coupling by soaking up electrons and ions from the 
gas phase and reducing the conductivity of the gas by many orders of 
magnitude. However, once grains have grown to a few microns in size 
their effect starts to wane and magnetic fields can begin to couple to 
the gas even at the disk midplane. Because ions are generally decoupled 
from the magnetic field by neutral collisions while electrons are not, 
the Hall effect tends to dominate the diffusion of the magnetic field 
when it is able to partially couple to the gas, except at the disk 
surfaces where the low density of neutrals permits the ions to remain 
attached to the field lines. For a standard population of 0.1 μm 
grains the active surface layers have a combined column 
Σactive≈2 g cm-2 at 1 {AU;} by the 
time grains have aggregated to 3 μm, Σactive≈80 g 
cm-2. Ionisation in the active layers is dominated by 
stellar X-rays. In the absence of grains, X-rays maintain magnetic 
coupling to 10\% of the disk material at 1 {AU} (i.e. 
Σactive≈150 g cm-2). At 5 {AU} the 
Σactive≈Σtotal once grains have 
aggregated to 1 μm in size.},

	abstract = {Traditionally stellar radiation has been the only heat source considered capable of determining global climate on long timescales. Here we show that terrestrial exoplanets orbiting low-mass stars may be tidally heated at high enough levels to induce a runaway greenhouse for a long enough duration for all the hydrogen to escape. Without hydrogen, the planet no longer has water and cannot support life. We call these planets {"Tidal} Venuses," and the phenomenon a "tidal greenhouse." Tidal effects also circularize the orbit, which decreases tidal heating. Hence, some planets may form with large eccentricity, with its accompanying large tidal heating, and lose their water, but eventually settle into nearly circular orbits in the habitable zone ({HZ).} However, these planets are not habitable as past tidal heating desiccated them, and hence should not be ranked highly for detailed follow-up observations aimed at detecting biosignatures. We simulate the evolution of hypothetical planetary systems in a quasi-continuous parameter distribution and find that we can constrain the history of the system by statistical arguments. Planets orbiting stars with masses {\textless}0.3 solar masses may be in danger of desiccation via tidal heating. We apply these concepts to Gl {667C} c, a {\textasciitilde}4.5 earth-mass planet orbiting a 0.3 solar mass star at 0.12 {AU.} We find that it probably did not lose its water via tidal heating as orbital stability is unlikely for the high eccentricities required for the tidal greenhouse. As the inner edge of the {HZ} is defined by the onset of a runaway or moist greenhouse powered by radiation, our results represent a fundamental revision to the {HZ} for non-circular orbits. In the appendices we review a) the moist and runaway greenhouses, b) stellar mass-radius and mass-luminosity relations, c) terrestrial planet mass-radius relations, and d) linear tidal theories.},

	abstract = {We examine the small-scale dynamics of black hole accretion disks in which radiation pressure exceeds gas pressure. Local patches of disk are modeled by numerically integrating the equations of radiation {MHD} in the flux-limited diffusion approximation. The shearing-box approximation is used, and the vertical component of gravity is neglected. Magnetorotational instability ({MRI)} leads to turbulence in which accretion stresses are due primarily to magnetic torques. When radiation is locked to gas over the length and timescales of fluctuations in the turbulence, the accretion stress, density contrast, and dissipation differ little from those in the corresponding calculations, with radiation replaced by extra gas pressure. However, when radiation diffuses each orbit a distance that is comparable to the rms vertical wavelength of the {MRI}, radiation pressure is less effective in resisting squeezing. Large density fluctuations occur, and radiation damping of compressive motions converts {PdV} work into photon energy. The accretion stress in calculations having a net vertical magnetic field is found to be independent of opacity over the range explored and approximately proportional to the square of the net field. In calculations with zero net magnetic flux, the accretion stress depends on the portion of the total pressure that is effective in resisting compression. The stress is lower when radiation diffuses rapidly with respect to the gas. We show that radiation-supported Shakura-Sunyaev disks accreting via internal magnetic stresses are likely to have radiation marginally coupled to turbulent gas motions in their interiors.},

We use our result to show that the saturated stresses in simulations with zero net magnetic flux depend linearly on the numerical resolution and would become negligible if the resolution were set equal to the natural dissipation scale in astrophysical disks. We conclude that in order for {MRI-driven} turbulent angular momentum transport to be able to account for the large value of the effective alpha viscosity inferred observationally, the disk must be threaded by a significant vertical magnetic field and the turbulent magnetic energy must be in near equipartition with the thermal energy.

These include the evolution of solar radio emissions associated with shocks driven by coronal mass ejections and searches for coherent radio emission from supernova remnants and relativistic jets. In addition, it is likely that unexpected objects or emission processes will be discovered by such an instrument, as has always happened when high resolution astronomical observations first become possible in a new region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The Astronomical Low Frequency Array ({ALFA)} mission will consist of 16 identical small satellites forming an aperture synthesis array. The satellites will cover the surface of a spherical region ≈ 100 km in diameter, thus providing good aperture plane coverage in all directions simultaneously. The array will operate in two medes: 1) “snapshot” imaging of strong, rapidly changing sources such as solar radio bursts and 2) long-term aperture synthesis observations for maximum sensitivity, high dynamic range imaging. In both cases a large number of array elements is needed.},

We first describe the model, and demonstrate its accuracy by comparing its predictions with exact results from numerical simulations of non-linear gravitational clustering. We then present several astrophysical applications of the halo model: these include models of the spatial distribution of galaxies, the non-linear velocity, momentum and pressure fields, descriptions of weak gravitational lensing, and estimates of secondary contributions to temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background.},

	abstract = {The formation of a solar system such as ours is believed to have followed a multi-stage process around a protostar and its associated accretion disk. Whipple first noted that planetesimal growth by particle agglomeration is strongly influenced by gas drag, and Cuzzi and colleagues have shown that when midplane particle mass densities approach or exceed those of the gas, solid-solid interactions dominate the drag effect. The size dependence of the drag creates a "bottleneck" at the meter scale with such bodies rapidly spiraling into the central star, whereas much smaller or larger particles do not. Independent of whether the origin of the drag is angular momentum exchange with gas or solids in the disk, successful planetary accretion requires rapid planetesimal growth to kilometer scales. A commonly accepted picture is that for collisional velocities Vc above a certain threshold value, V th{\textasciitilde} 0.1-10 cm s-1, particle agglomeration is not possible; elastic rebound overcomes attractive surface and intermolecular forces. However, if perfect sticking is assumed for all ranges of interparticle collision speeds the bottleneck can be overcome by rapid planetesimal growth. While previous work has dealt with the influences of collisional pressures and the possibility of particle fracture or penetration, the basic role of the phase behavior of matter-phase diagrams, amorphs, and polymorphs—has been neglected. Here, it is demonstrated for compact bodies that novel aspects of surface phase transitions provide a physical basis for efficient sticking through collisional melting/amorphization/polymorphization and subsequent fusion/annealing to extend the collisional velocity range of primary accretion to {ΔVc} {\textasciitilde} 1-100 m s-1 Gt V th, which encompasses both typical turbulent rms speeds and the velocity differences between boulder-sized and small grains {\textasciitilde}1-50 m s-1. Therefore, as inspiraling meter-sized bodies collide with smaller particles in this high velocity collisional fusion regime they grow sufficiently rapidly to {\textasciitilde}0.1-1 km scale and settle into stable Keplerian orbits in {\textasciitilde}105 years before photoevaporative wind clears the disk of source material. The basic theory applies to low and high melting temperature materials and thus to the inner and outer regions of a nebula.},

We use a disk model that is local in the sense that it incorporates tidal and Coriolis forces but neglects background gradients in pressure and density. For simplicity we omit the vertical component of gravity and employ periodic boundary conditions in the vertical and azimuthal directions, and shearing-periodic boundary conditions in the radial direction. Our numerical method is an implementation of the "method of characteristics-constrained transport" algorithm. Most of the simulations begin with either a purely vertical or purely azimuthal magnetic field. Our major result is that turbulence is initiated and sustained by the magnetic instability. We provide a detailed characterization of the saturated turbulent state. The turbulence is anisotropic in a sense that implies an outward flux of angular momentum. The turbulent energy and angular momentum flux is dominated by magnetic stress rather than Reynolds stress. Most of the energy and angular momentum flux is concentrated at the largest scales. We find that the magnetic energy density in the saturated state is proportional to the product of the size of the simulation box and the initial field strength and is independent of the sound speed.},

We adopt a local disk model in which the physical quantities are assumed to be spatially uniform except for the shear velocity in the azimuthal direction. Starting with a weak vertical field, the magnetorotational instability is saturated in the nonlinear regime when the magnetic Reynolds number R\_m is less than unity. In the saturated turbulent state, the growth of the magnetic field for the instability and the damping by the ohmic dissipation are almost balanced. The efficiency of angular momentum transport alpha is of the order of 10{\textasciicircum}-2 to 10{\textasciicircum}-3, and alpha is found to be inversely proportional to the initial beta value. When R\_m{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1, channel solutions appear and the magnetic energy continues growing even with the dissipation process. We can roughly explain these features with the help of the results obtained by the linear analysis. Our conclusion is that the magnetic dissipation is one of the most important processes that determine the saturation level of the magnetorotational instability.},

Together with our previously published {JHKL} investigations of the younger {NGC} 2024, Trapezium, and {IC} 348 clusters, we have completed the first systematic and homogeneous survey for circumstellar disks in a sample of young clusters that both span a significant range in age (0.3-30 Myr) and contain statistically significant numbers of stars whose masses span nearly the entire stellar mass spectrum. Analysis of the combined survey indicates that the cluster disk fraction is initially very high ({\textgreater}=80\%) and rapidly decreases with increasing cluster age, such that one-half the stars within the clusters lose their disks in {\textless}{\textasciitilde}3 Myr. Moreover, these observations yield an overall disk lifetime of {\textasciitilde}6 Myr in the surveyed cluster sample. This is the timescale for essentially all the stars in a cluster to lose their disks. This should set a meaningful constraint for the planet-building timescale in stellar clusters.

We show that dust-dust collisional charging becomes an important process in determining the charge state of dust and gas if there is dust enhancement and/or dust is fluffy, so that dust surface area per disc volume is locally increased. We solve the charge equilibrium equations for various disc environments and dust number density η, using general purpose graphic processor units and {CUDA} programming language. We found that as the dust number density η increases, the charge distribution experiences four phases. In one of these phases, the electrostatic field E caused by dust motion increases as E {\textasciitilde} η4. As a result, macroscopic electric discharge takes place, for example at η = 70 (in units of minimum-mass solar nebula values, considering two groups of fluffy dust with radii of 10-2 and 102cm, respectively). We present a model that describes the charge-exchange processes in the discs as an electric circuit. We derive analytical formulae of critical dust number density for lightning, as functions of dust parameters. We estimate the total energy, intensity and event ratio of such discharges (`lightning'). We discuss the possibility of observing lightning and sprite discharges in protoplanetary discs by astronomically low frequency waves, infrared images, ultraviolet lines and high energy gamma rays. We also discuss the effects of lightning on chondrule heating, planetesimal growth and magnetorotational instability of the disc.},

	abstract = {A supra-photoswitch is designed for complete {ON/OFF} switching of {DNA} hybridization by light irradiation for the purpose of using {DNA} as a material for building nanostructures. Azobenzenes, attached to D-threoninols that function as scaffolds, are introduced into each {DNA} strand after every two natural nucleotides (in the form ({NNX)n} where N and X represent the natural nucleotide and the azobenzene moiety, respectively). Hybridization of these two modified strands forms a supra-photoswitch consisting of alternating natural base pairs and azobenzene moieties. In this newly designed sequence, each base pair is sandwiched between two azobenzene moieties and all the azobenzene moieties are separated by base pairs. When the duplex is irradiated by visible light, the azobenzene moieties take the trans form and this duplex is surprisingly stable compared to the corresponding native duplex composed of only natural oligonucleotides. On the other hand, when the azobenzene moieties are isomerized to the cis form by {UV} light irradiation, the duplex is completely dissociated. Based on this design, a {DNA} hairpin structure is synthesized that should be closed by visible light irradiation and opened by {UV} light irradiation at the level of a single molecule. Indeed, perfect {ON/OFF} photoregulation is attained. This is a promising strategy for the design of supra-photoswitches such as photoresponsive sticky ends on {DNA} nanodevices and other nanostructures.},

The equations of self-gravitating hydrodynamics are derived self-consistently from a Lagrangian and account for variable smoothing length (`grad-h') terms in both the hydrodynamic and the gravitational acceleration equations. The evolution of the magnetic field is formulated in terms of so-called Euler potentials which are advected with the fluid and thus guarantee the {MHD} flux-freezing condition. This formulation is equivalent to a vector potential approach and therefore fulfils the ∇ . B = 0 constraint by construction. Extensive tests in one, two and three dimensions are presented. The tests demonstrate the excellent conservation properties of the code and show the clear superiority of the Euler potentials over earlier magnetic {SPH} formulations.},

We adopt the most compact form of {CT}, which requires the field be represented by area-averages at cell faces. We demonstrate that the fluxes of the area-averaged field used by {CT} can be made consistent with the fluxes of the volume-averaged field returned by a Riemann solver if they obey certain simple relationships. We use these relationships to derive new algorithms for constructing the {CT} fluxes at grid cell corners which reduce exactly to the equivalent one-dimensional solver for plane-parallel, grid-aligned flow. We show that the {PPM} reconstruction algorithm must include multidimensional terms for {MHD}, and we describe a number of important extensions that must be made to {CTU} in order for it to be used for {MHD} with {CT.} We present the results of a variety of test problems to demonstrate the method is accurate and robust.},

	abstract = {The process that melted and formed the chondrules, millimeter-sized glassy beads within meteorites, has not been conclusively identified. Origin by lightning in the solar nebula is consistent with many features of chondrules, but no viable model of lightning has yet been advanced. We present a model demonstrating how lightning could be generated in the solar nebula which differs from previous models in two important aspects. First, we identify a new, powerful charging mechanism that is based on the differences in contact potentials between particles of different composition, a form of triboelectric charging. In the presence of fine silicate grains and fine iron metal grains, large silicate particles (the chondrules) can acquire charges {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}+105e. Second, we assume that the chondrule precursor particles are selectively concentrated in clumps {\textasciitilde}100 km in size by the turbulent concentration mechanism described by J. N. Cuzzi et al. (1996, in Chondrules and the Protoplanetary Disk, pp. 35-43, Cambridge Univ. Press). The concentration of these highly charged particles into clumps, in a background of negatively charged metal grains, is what generates the strong electric fields. We calculate that electric fields large enough to trigger breakdown easily could have existed over regions large enough ({\textasciitilde}100 km) to generate very large discharges of electrical energy ({\textasciitilde}1016 erg), assuming a lightning bolt width {\textless}{\textasciitilde}10 electron mean-free paths. The discharges would have been sufficiently energetic to have formed the chondrules. We place constraints on the generation of lightning and conclude that it could not be generated if the abundance of {26Al} in chondrules was as high as the level in the calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions ({CAIs).} This conclusion is consistent with isotopic analyses of chondrules. This possibly implies that {26Al} was nonuniformly distributed in the solar nebula or that the chondrules formed several million years after the {CAIs.}},

The sticking probability of thermal electrons on grains is found to be between 0.3 and 1.0, and that of the ions about 1.0. The charge-state distribution of grains is determined as a function of the grain radius and the gas temperature, and it is found that most grains have one excess electron. With some reasonable grain models the recombination rate per unit volume per unit time of the electron and the ion X+ is given by {αgnHn(X+)}, where {nH} = n(H)+2n(H2) and n(X+) are the number densities of hydrogen and the ion X+, respectively, and αg ≍ 5 × 10-17 cm-3 s-1 for the metal ions. By using a simplified reaction scheme in the gas phase together with the recombination of ions and electrons on grains, the ionization degree of the gas in the steady state is investigated and it is found that the ionization degree x(e) decreases at least by a factor of 10 compared with that without grain surface recombination, and that x(e) agrees well with the values estimated from the observations without assuming the extreme depletion of metals in the gas phase.},

planetesimals in the disks of cluster members. However, we find some 
evidence that the frequency of circumstellar primordial disks is lower,

populations with similar ages. This could be evidence for a relatively 
fast dissipation of circumstellar dust by the strong radiation field 
from the highest mass star(s) in the cluster. Another possibility is 
that γ Velorum stellar cluster is slightly older than reported

	volume = {496},
	abstract = {Aims: The aim of this paper is to study the vertical profile of small dust particles in protoplanetary discs in which angular momentum transport is due to {MHD} turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability. We consider particle sizes that range from approximately 1 micron up to a few millimeters.
Methods: We use a grid-based {MHD} code to perform global two-fluid simulations of turbulent protoplanetary discs which contain dust grains of various sizes.
Results: In quasi-steady state, the gravitational settling of dust particles is balanced by turbulent diffusion. Simple and standard models of this process fail to describe accurately the vertical profile of the dust density. The disagreement is larger for small dust particles (of a few microns in size), especially in the disc upper layers (Z{\textgreater}{3H}, where H is the scale-height). Here there can be orders of magnitude in the disagreement between the simple model predictions and the simulation results. This is because {MHD} turbulence is not homogeneous in accretion discs, since velocity fluctuations increase significantly in the disc upper layer where a strongly magnetized corona develops. We provide an alternative model that gives a better fit to the simulations. In this model, dust particles are diffused away from the midplane by {MHD} turbulence, but the diffusion coefficient varies vertically and is everywhere proportional to the square of the local turbulent vertical velocity fluctuations.
Conclusions: The spatial distribution of dust particles can be used to trace the properties of {MHD} turbulence in protoplanetary discs, such as the amplitude of the velocity fluctuations. In the future, detailed and direct comparison between numerical simulations and observations should prove a useful tool for constraining the properties of turbulence in protoplanetary discs.},

	volume = {464},
	url = {http://ads.nao.ac.jp/abs/1996ApJ...464..690H},
	abstract = {Using three-dimensional numerical simulations, we have found that the weak-field magnetorotational instability constitutes a hydromagnetic dynamo in astrophysical disks. The field amplification mechanism lies outside the scope of kinematic dynamo theory and implies that kinematic dynamo theory is not applicable to accretion disk systems. We begin with simulations of isotropic, homogeneous turbulence to demonstrate the ability of our finite-difference code to reproduce known dynamos. To calibrate our code, we measure magnetic field rates when the turbulent velocity field is not sustained through external forcing. When the turbulence is maintained with imposed velocity fields, a magnetic dynamo can be produced. Two cases are considered: velocity fields with and without net helicity. Both the helical and the nonhelical velocity fields amplify and sustain magnetic fields despite substantial turbulent dissipation. The nonhelical dynamo increases the magnetic field energy by an order of magnitude. The helical dynamo produces greater amplification (a factor of 30 in energy) and a more ordered field. Lorentz forces eventually limit the growth of the magnetic field in both cases. We next carry out simulations in the local shearing box model of an accretion disk. The initial magnetic field has a mean field value of zero over the computational domain and is weak in the sense that the initial Alfvén speed is much less than the sound speed. The magnetorotational instability rapidly generates turbulence within the disk. The turbulence is anisotropic, producing significant Maxwell and Reynolds stresses that transport angular momentum outward. Both the stresses and magnetic energy density remain subthermal and do not approach equipartition. The magnetic energy is amplified by a factor of 20 and maintained for over 200 orbits of time, far longer than the magnetic decay time in the absence of an amplification mechanism. A parameter survey indicates the final turbulent state does not depend on the initial average field strength; some dependence on the computational domain size, magnetic Prandtl number, and numerical resolution is observed. Finally, we demonstrate explicitly that more than shear and turbulence are required to produce dynamo amplification of magnetic fields.},

	abstract = {This is the first of a series of papers aimed at developing and interpreting simulations of protoplanets interacting with turbulent accretion discs. In this first paper we study the turbulent disc models prior to the introduction of a perturbing protoplanet. We study cylindrical disc models in which a central domain is in Keplerian rotation and unstable to the magnetorotational instability. Models of varying disc size and aspect ratio H/r are considered with magnetic fields having zero net flux. We relate the properties of the turbulent models to classical viscous disc theory. All models were found to attain a turbulent state in their Keplerian domains with volume averaged stress parameter α{\textasciitilde} 5 × 10-3. At any particular time the vertically and azimuthally averaged value exhibited large fluctuations in radius. However, an additional time average over periods exceeding three orbital periods at the outer boundary of the Keplerian domain resulted in a more smoothly varying quantity with radial variations within a factor of 2 or so. The vertically and azimuthally averaged radial velocity showed much larger spatial and temporal fluctuations, requiring additional time averaging for at least seven to eight orbital periods at the outer boundary of the Keplerian domain to limit them. Comparison with the value derived from the averaged stress using viscous disc theory yielded schematic agreement for feasible averaging times but with some indication that the effects of residual fluctuations remained. The behaviour described above must be borne in mind when considering laminar disc simulations with anomalous Navier-Stokes viscosity. This is because the operation of a viscosity, as in classical viscous disc theory with anomalous viscosity coefficient, cannot apply to a turbulent disc undergoing rapid changes due to external perturbation. The classical theory can only be used to describe the time averaged behaviour of the parts of the disc that are in a statistically steady condition long enough for appropriate averaging to be carried out.},

	abstract = {Grid-based magnetohydrodynamic ({MHD)} simulations have proven invaluable 
for the study of astrophysical accretion disks. However, the fact that 
angular momentum transport in disks is mediated by {MHD} turbulence (with 
structure down to very small scales) raises the concern that the 
properties of the modeled accretion disks are affected by the finite 
numerical resolution of the simulation. By implementing an orbital 
advection algorithm into the Athena code in cylindrical geometry, we 
have performed a set of global (but unstratified) Newtonian disk 
simulations extending up to resolutions previously unattained. We study 
the convergence of these models as a function of spatial resolution and 
initial magnetic field geometry. The usual viscosity parameter 
(\${\textbackslash}alpha\$) or the ratio of thermal-to-magnetic pressure (\${\textbackslash}beta\$) are 
found to be poor diagnostics of convergence, whereas the average tilt 
angle of the magnetic field in the \$(r,{\textbackslash}phi)\$-plane is a very good 
diagnostic of convergence. We suggest that this is related to the 
saturation of the {MHD} turbulence via parasitic modes of the 
magnetorotational instability. Even in the case of zero-net magnetic 
flux, we conclude that our highest resolution simulations (with 32-zones 
and 64-zones per vertical scale height) have achieved convergence. Our 
global simulations reach resolutions comparable to those used in local, 
shearing box models of {MHD} disk turbulence. We find that the saturation 
predictors derived from local simulations correspond well to the 
instantaneous correlations between local flux and stress found in our 
global simulations. However, the conservation of magnetic flux implicit 
in local models is not realized in our global disks. Thus, the magnetic 
connectivity of an accretion disk represents physics that is truly 
global and cannot be captured in any ab-initio local model.},

We find that the transition objects in Taurus occupy a restricted region of the  versus Mdisc plane. Compared to non-transition single stars in Taurus, they have stellar accretion rates that are typically ∼10 times lower at the same disc mass and median disc masses approximately four times larger. These properties are anticipated by several proposed planet formation theories and suggest that the formation of Jovian mass planets may play a significant role in explaining the origin of at least some transition objects. Considering transition objects as a distinct demographic group among accreting T Tauri stars leads to a tighter relationship between disc masses and stellar accretion rates, with a slope between the two quantities that is close to the value of unity expected in simple theories of disc accretion.},

I discuss possible sub-{MHz} sources and set new non-trivial upper limits on the energy density of sub-{MHz} radio waves in galaxy clusters and the average cosmic background. Limits based on five effects are considered: (1) changes in the expansion of the Universe from the radiation energy density, (2) heating of the {IGM} by free-free absorption, (3) radiation pressure squeezing of {IGM} clouds by external radio waves, (4) synchrotron heating of electrons in clusters and (5) inverse Compton upscattering of sub-{MHz} radio photons. Any sub-{MHz} background must have an energy density much smaller than the cosmic microwave background at frequencies below {1MHz.} The free-free absorption bounds from the Lyman α (Lyα) forest are potentially the strongest, but are highly dependent on the properties of sub-{MHz} radio scattering in the {IGM.} I estimate an upper limit of 6 × 104 Lsolar Mpc-3 for the emissivity within Lyα forest clouds in the frequency range of 5-{200Hz.} The sub-{MHz} energy density in the Coma cluster is constrained to be less than {\textasciitilde} 10-15 ergcm -3. At present, none of the limits is strong enough to rule out a maximal Tb = 1012 K sub-{MHz} synchrotron background, but other sources may be constrained with better knowledge of sub-{MHz} radio propagation in the {IGM.}},

	abstract = {Magnetic fields likely play a key role in the dynamics and evolution of protoplanetary disks. They have the potential to efficiently transport angular momentum by {MHD} turbulence or via the magnetocentrifugal acceleration of outflows from the disk surface. Magnetically-driven mixing has implications for disk chemistry and evolution of the grain population, and the effective viscous response of the disk determines whether planets migrate inwards or outwards. However, the weak ionisation of protoplanetary disks means that magnetic fields may not be able to effectively couple to the matter. I examine the magnetic diffusivity in a minimum solar nebula model and present calculations of the ionisation equilibrium and magnetic diffusivity as a function of height from the disk midplane at radii of 1 and 5 {AU.} Dust grains tend to suppress magnetic coupling by soaking up electrons and ions from the gas phase and reducing the conductivity of the gas by many orders of magnitude. However, once grains have grown to a few microns in size their effect starts to wane and magnetic fields can begin to couple to the gas even at the disk midplane. Because ions are generally decoupled from the magnetic field by neutral collisions while electrons are not, the Hall effect tends to dominate the diffusion of the magnetic field when it is able to partially couple to the gas, except at the disk surfaces where the low density of neutrals permits the ions to remain attached to the field lines. For a standard population of 0.1 μm grains the active surface layers have a combined column Σ active ≈2 g cm −2 at 1 {AU;} by the time grains have aggregated to 3 μm, Σ active ≈80 g cm −2 . Ionisation in the active layers is dominated by stellar X-rays. In the absence of grains, X-rays maintain magnetic coupling to 10\% of the disk material at 1 {AU} (i.e. Σ active ≈150 g cm −2 ). At 5 {AU} the Σ active ≈Σ total once grains have aggregated to 1 μm in size.},

	abstract = {First, distributions of surface densities of dust materials and gases in a preplanetary solar nebula, which give a good fit to the distribution of the planetary mass, are presented and the over-all structure of this nebula, which is in thermal and gravitational equilibrium, is studied. Second, in order to see magnetic effect on the structure, electric conductivity of a gas ionized by cosmic rays and radioactivities contained in dust grains is estimated for each region of the nebula and, then, the growth and decay of seed magnetic fields, which are due to differential rotation of the nebula and to the Joule dissipation, respectively, are calculated. The results indicate that, in regions of the terrestrial planets, magnetic fields decay much faster than they grow and magnetic effects can be ignored, except for the outermost layers of very low density. This is not the case for regions of Uranus and Neptune where magnetic fields can be amplified to considerable extents. Third, the transport of angular momentum due to magnetic and mechanical turbulent viscosities and the resultant redistribution of surface density in the nebula are investigated. The results show that the density redistribution occurs, in general, in a direction to attain a distribution of surface density which has nearly the same r-dependence as that obtained from the present distribution of the planetary mass. This redistribution seems to be possible if it occurs at a formation stage of the nebula where the presence of large viscosities is expected. Finally, a comment is given on the initial condition of a collapsing interstellar cloud from which the solar nebula is formed at the end of the collapse.},

	abstract = {We numerically evolve turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability ({MRI)} in a three-dimensional, unstratified shearing box and study its structure using two-point correlation functions. We confirm Fromang and Papaloizou's result that shearing box models with zero net magnetic flux are not converged; the dimensionless shear stress α is proportional to the grid scale. We find that the two-point correlation of B shows that it is composed of narrow filaments that are swept back by differential rotation into a trailing spiral. The correlation lengths along each of the correlation function principal axes decrease monotonically with the grid scale. For mean azimuthal field models, which we argue are more relevant to astrophysical disks than the zero net field models, we find that: α increases weakly with increasing resolution at fixed box size; α increases slightly as the box size is increased; α increases linearly with net field strength, confirming earlier results; the two-point correlation function of the magnetic field is resolved and converged, and is composed of narrow filaments swept back by the shear; the major axis of the two-point increases slightly as the box size is increased; these results are code independent, based on a comparison of {ATHENA} and {ZEUS} runs. The velocity, density, and magnetic fields decorrelate over scales larger than {\textasciitilde}H, as do the dynamical terms in the magnetic energy evolution equations.

	abstract = {We calculate the ionisation fraction in protostellar disk models using a 
number of different chemical reaction networks, including gas-phase and 
gas-grain reaction schemes. The disk models we consider are conventional 
α-disks, which include viscous heating and radiative cooling. The 
primary source of ionisation is assumed to be X-ray irradiation from the 
central star. For most calculations we adopt a specific disk model (with 
accretion rate dot M=10-7 M\&sun; yr-1 
and α=10-2), and examine the predictions 
made by the chemical networks concerning the ionisation fraction, 
magnetic Reynolds number, and spatial extent of magnetically active 
regions. This is to aid comparison between the different chemical 
models. We consider a number of gas-phase chemical networks. The 
simplest is the five species model proposed by Oppenheimer \& 
Dalgarno (1974). We construct more complex models by extracting species 
and reactions from the {UMIST} data base. In general we find that the 
simple models predict higher fractional ionisation levels and more 
extensive active zones than the more complex models. When heavy metal 
atoms are included the simple models predict that the disk is 
magnetically active throughout. The complex models predict that 
extensive regions of the disk remain magnetically uncoupled ("dead") 
even when the fractional abundance of magnesium {x\_Mg=10-8.} 
This is because of the large number of molecular ions that are formed, 
which continue to dominate the recombination with free electrons in the 
presence of magnesium. The addition of submicron sized grains with a 
concentration of x\_gr=10-12 causes the size of the "dead 
zone" to increase dramatically for all kinetic models considered, as the 
grains are highly efficient at sweeping up the free electrons. We find 
that the simple and complex gas-grain reaction schemes agree on the size 
and structure of the resulting "dead zone", as the grains play a 
dominant role in determining the ionisation fraction. We examine the 
effects of depleting the concentration of small grains as a crude means 
of modeling the growth of grains during planet formation. We find that a 
depletion factor of 10-4 causes the gas-grain chemistry to 
converge to the gas-phase chemistry when heavy metals are absent. When 
magnesium is included a depletion factor of 10-8 is required 
to reproduce the gas-phase ionisation fraction. This suggests that 
efficient grain growth and settling will be required in protoplanetary 
disks, before a substantial fraction of the disk mass in the planet 
forming zone between 1-10 {AU} becomes magnetically active and turbulent. 
Only after this has occurred can gas-phase chemical models be used to 
predict reliably the ionisation degree in protoplanetary disks.},

	abstract = {Implicit time differencing of the resistive magnetohydrodynamic ({MHD)} equations can step over the limiting time scales—such as Alfvén time scales—to resolve the dynamic time scales of interest. However, nonlinearities present in these equations make an implicit implementation cumbersome. Here, viable paths for an implicit, nonlinear time integration of the {MHD} equations are explored using a {2D} reduced viscoresistive {MHD} model. The implicit time integration is performed using the {Newton–Raphson} iterative algorithm, employing Krylov iterative techniques for the required algebraic matrix inversions, implemented Jacobian-free (i.e., without ever forming and storing the Jacobian matrix). Convergence in Krylov techniques is accelerated by preconditioning the initial problem. A “physics-based” preconditioner, based on a semi-implicit approximation to the original set of partial differential equations, is employed. The preconditioner employs low-complexity multigrid techniques to invert approximately the resulting elliptic algebraic systems. The resulting {2D} reduced resistive {MHD} implicit algorithm is shown to be successful in dealing with large time steps (on the order of the dynamical time scale of the problem) and fine grids.

	abstract = {The mechanical properties of metal materials largely depend on their intrinsic internal microstructures. To develop engineering materials with the expected properties, predicting patterns in solidified metals would be indispensable. The phase-field simulation is the most powerful method known to simulate the micro-scale dendritic growth during solidification in a binary alloy. To evaluate the realistic description of solidification, however, phase-field simulation requires computing a large number of complex nonlinear terms over a fine-grained grid. Due to such heavy computational demand, previous work on simulating three-dimensional solidification with phase-field methods was successful only in describing simple shapes. Our new simulation techniques achieved scales unprecedentedly large, sufficient for handling complex dendritic structures required in material science. Our simulations on the {GPU-rich} {TSUBAME} 2.0 supercomputer at the Tokyo Institute of Technology have demonstrated good weak scaling and achieved 1.017 {PFlops} in single precision for our largest configuration, using 4,000 {GPUs} along with 16,000 {CPU} cores.},

	abstract = {The present operation of the ground-based network of gravitational-wave laser interferometers in enhanced configuration and the beginning of the construction of second-generation (or advanced) interferometers with planned observation runs beginning by 2015 bring the search for gravitational waves into a regime where detection is highly plausible. The development of techniques that allow us to discriminate a signal of astrophysical origin from instrumental artefacts in the interferometer data and to extract the full range of information are therefore some of the primary goals of the current work. Here we report the details of a Bayesian approach to the problem of inference for gravitational wave observations using a network (containing an arbitrary number) of instruments, for the computation of the Bayes factor between two hypotheses and the evaluation of the marginalized posterior density functions of the unknown model parameters. The numerical algorithm to tackle the notoriously difficult problem of the evaluation of large multidimensional integrals is based on a technique known as nested sampling, which provides an attractive (and possibly superior) alternative to more traditional Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods. We discuss the details of the implementation of this algorithm and its performance against a Gaussian model of the background noise, considering the specific case of the signal produced by the in-spiral of binary systems of black holes and/or neutron stars, although the method is completely general and can be applied to other classes of sources. We also demonstrate the utility of this approach by introducing a new coherence test to distinguish between the presence of a coherent signal of astrophysical origin in the data of multiple instruments and the presence of incoherent accidental artefacts, and the effects on the estimation of the source parameters as a function of the number of instruments in the network.},

	abstract = {The characteristics of many close, evolved binaries can be understood 
most easily if there exists some agency that can abstract angular 
momentum or mass, or both, from the precursor system. Close binaries may 
be defined as systems in which at least one of the components has filled 
or will fill its Roche lobe and attempt to transfer matter to its 
companion. If the time scale for mass transfer is considerably shorter 
than the time scale on which the accretor can adjust thermally to the 
proffered mass, the accreted layer will heat up, expand, and fill the 
Roche lobe of the accretor. The mass lost by the donor thereafter flows 
into a 'common envelope' ({CE)} which encompasses both stars. The 
frictional interaction between this common envelope and the stellar 
cores produces drag forces that cause the cores to spiral in toward one 
another; some of the orbital energy helps drive matter from the {CE} into 
interstellar space. Examples of systems which are experiencing or have 
experienced this process include some planetary nebulae, cataclysmic 
variables, and close binary degenerate stars. Similar situations can 
arise if one of the components can support, of its own accord, a dense 
wind that flows out of the system; the drag luminosity produced by 
interaction between the companion and the wind may intensify the wind 
and contribute to mass loss from the donor. Systems undergoing this 
'wind-{CE'} process include novae and close binaries containing an {OB} 
star. Planetary nebulae with close binary central stars are actually 
ejected {CEs}, and precursors of many cataclysmic variables were once the 
central stars of planetary nebulae formed in a {CE} event. In this review, 
we (1) describe various initial configurations which will produce a {CE}, 
(2) discuss the physics of the {CE} event, (3) describe attempts to model 
the event quantitatively, and (4) apply what we have learned to 
describe, in several real situations, the transformations wrought by 
evolution through a {CE} phase.},

	abstract = {Usually, non-stationary numerical calculations in electromagnetics are based on the hyperbolic evolution equations for the electric and magnetic fields and leave Gauss' law out of consideration because the latter is a consequence of the former and of the charge conservation equation in the continuous case. However, in the simulation of the self-consistent movement of charged particles in electromagnetic fields, it is a well-known fact that the approximation of the particle motion introduces numerical errors and that, consequently, the charge conservation equation is not satisfied on the dicrete level. Then, in order to avoid the increase of errors in Gauss' law, a divergence cleaning step which solves a Poisson equation for a correction potential is often added. In the present paper, a new method for incorporating Gauss' law into non-stationary electromagnetic simulation codes is developed, starting from a constrained formulation of the Maxwell equations. The resulting system is hyperbolic, and the divergence errors propagate with the speed of light to the boundary of the computational domain. Furthermore, the basic ideas of the numerical approximation are introduced and the extended hyperbolic system is treated numerically within the framework of high-resolution finite-volume schemes. Simulation results obtained with this new technique for pure electromagnetic wave propagation and for an electromagnetic particle-in-cell computation are presented and compared with other methods.},

	abstract = {{Aims:We} study the properties of {MHD} turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability ({MRI)} in accretion disks. To do this we perform a series of numerical simulations for which the resolution is gradually increased.
Methods: We adopt the local shearing box model and focus on the special case for which the initial magnetic flux threading the disk vanishes. We employ the finite difference code {ZEUS} to evolve the ideal {MHD} equations.
Results: Performing a set of numerical simulations in a fixed computational domain with increasing resolution, we demonstrate that turbulent activity decreases as resolution increases. The highest resolution considered is 256 grid cells per scale height. We quantify the turbulent activity by measuring the rate of angular momentum transport through evaluating the standard α parameter. We find α = 0.004 when ({N\_x,N\_y,N\_z)} = (64,100,64), α = 0.002 when ({N\_x,N\_y,N\_z)} = (128,200,128) and α = 0.001 when ({N\_x,N\_y,N\_z)} = (256,400,256). This steady decline is an indication that numerical dissipation, occurring at the grid scale is an important determinant of the saturated form of the {MHD} turbulence. Analysing the results in Fourier space, we demonstrate that this is due to the {MRI} forcing significant flow energy all the way down to the grid dissipation scale. We also use our results to study the properties of the numerical dissipation in {ZEUS.} Its amplitude is characterised by the magnitude of an effective magnetic Reynolds number {ReM} which increases from 104 to 105 as the number of grid points is increased from 64 to 256 per scale height.
Conclusions: The simulations we have carried out do not produce results that are independent of the numerical dissipation scale, even at the highest resolution studied. Thus it is important to use physical dissipation, both viscous and resistive, and to quantify contributions from numerical effects, when performing numerical simulations of {MHD} turbulence with zero net flux in accretion disks at the resolutions normally considered.},

	title = {Numerical simulation of a hot dry rock geothermal reservoir in the Cooper Basin, South Australia},
	url = {http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:173606},
	abstract = {This thesis describes the development and production of numerical simulations of the creation of a Hot Dry Rock ({HDR)} geothermal reservoir. This geothermal reservoir that was simulated is owned by Geodynamics Limited and is located in the Cooper Basin, South Australia. The simulations show the geometry of the geothermal reservoir and predict the productive lifespan of the reservoir. Geothermal energy, which is the thermal energy that is stored in the interior of the earth, is an enormous energy source and as such there is great interest in technology that allows this energy to be harnessed. The {HDR} process of extracting the geothermal energy from rock involves drilling a borehole to a suitable depth and injecting cold water into the rock via this well (known as the injection well) to create a reservoir by opening up fractures in the rock. As water is forced through the reservoir, heat is extracted from the rock via conduction and transferred to the water, creating an heat exchange. Warm water is brought to the surface via another well known as the extraction well. The heat from the water is used to generate electricity and then the water is fed back into the injection well, completing the cycle. The creation of a {HDR} geothermal reservoir comprises of many aspects: the injection of the fluid into the jointed rock system, the opening and shearing of the joints, the creation of the fluid reservoir in the rock and the temperature effects of the fluid flow through the joints. This work incorporates all of these aspects. Due to the multi-physics nature of this process multiple computational modelling strategies were implemented to allow for authentic simulation of the entire process. The mechanical rock behaviour was primarily simulated the Distinct Element Method. This two dimensional Distinct Element Method program allowed for a realistically scaled model of the whole geothermal reservoir to be developed. This model was particularly useful for modelling the joint behaviour as the discrete nature of this method compares well with the joint system on such a scale. A discrete particle based model was used to model the joint behaviour on a small scale. These models demonstrated the behaviour of joints under compressional strain, showing slip and the effects of joint dilatancy. The productive lifespan of the geothermal reservoir was modelled using a Finite Element Method program based on Darcy's Law and an height-averaged heat equation. The aim of this model was to simulate the effects on the rock temperature of the fluid flow through the reservoir. The lifespan of the reservoir with differing well geometries was tested using this model to show which geometry would extend the productive lifetime of the geothermal reservoir. The results produced from the {DEM} models showed that the reservoir geometry is very much dependent upon the joint angle, and under the Cooper Basin stress regime steeper joints will be more likely to open. Joint dilatancy also affects the fluid flow rates as the amount of joint opening is dependent upon the joint dilatancy angle. The modelling of the temperature drawdown of the rock due to the fluid flow showed that a square configuration of wells is the ideal configuration to prolong the productive lifespan of the {HDR} geothermal reservoir. Results produced with the modelling parameters provided by Geodynamics Limited indicate that the productive lifespan of the Cooper Basin {HDR} geothermal reservoir created is approximately 50 years. This reservoir is only one of many that can be created at the site to prolong the productivity of the energy plant. The combined results of this modelling strategy give an overall image of the creation and lifetime of the {HDR} geothermal energy plant in the Cooper Basin.},

Second, we show that in the disk with dust grains the energetic electrons that compose electric currents in weakly ionized gas can provide collisional ionization, depending on the actual saturation state of magnetorotational turbulence. On the other hand, we show that in the protoplanetary disks with the reduced effect of dust grains, the turbulent motion can homogenize the ionization degree, which can activate magnetorotational instability even in the absence of other ionization processes. The results in this Letter indicate that most of the regions in protoplanetary disks remain magnetically active, and we thus require a change in the theoretical modeling of planet formation.},

	abstract = {The ideal {MHD} equations are a central model in astrophysics, and their solution relies upon stable numerical schemes. We present an implementation of a new method, which possesses excellent stability properties. Numerical tests demonstrate that the theoretical stability properties are valid in practice with negligible compromises to accuracy. The result is a highly robust scheme with state-of-the-art efficiency. The scheme’s robustness is due to entropy stability, positivity and properly discretised Powell terms. The implementation takes the form of a modification of the {MHD} module in the {FLASH} code, an adaptive mesh refinement code. We compare the new scheme with the standard {FLASH} implementation for {MHD.} Results show comparable accuracy to standard {FLASH} with the Roe solver, but highly improved efficiency and stability, particularly for high Mach number flows and low plasma β. The tests include {1D} shock tubes, {2D} instabilities and highly supersonic, {3D} turbulence. We consider turbulent flows with {RMS} sonic Mach numbers up to 10, typical of gas flows in the interstellar medium. We investigate both strong initial magnetic fields and magnetic field amplification by the turbulent dynamo from extremely high plasma β. The energy spectra show a reasonable decrease in dissipation with grid refinement, and at a resolution of 5123 grid cells we identify a narrow inertial range with the expected power law scaling. The turbulent dynamo exhibits exponential growth of magnetic pressure, with the growth rate higher from solenoidal forcing than from compressive forcing. Two versions of the new scheme are presented, using relaxation-based 3-wave and 5-wave approximate Riemann solvers, respectively. The 5-wave solver is more accurate in some cases, and its computational cost is close to the 3-wave solver.},

	abstract = {Mutual sticking of dust aggregates is the first step toward planetesimal formation in protoplanetary disks. In spite that the electric charging of dust particles is well recognized in some contexts, it has been largely ignored in the current modeling of dust coagulation. In this study, we present a general analysis of the dust charge state in protoplanetary disks, and then demonstrate how the electric charging could dramatically change the currently accepted scenario of dust coagulation. First, we describe a new semianalytical method to calculate the dust charge state and gas ionization state self-consistently. This method is far more efficient than previous numerical methods, and provides a general and clear description of the charge state of a gas-dust mixture. Second, we apply this analysis to compute the collisional cross section of growing aggregates taking their charging into account. As an illustrative example, we focus on early evolutionary stages where the dust has been thought to grow into fractal (D {\textasciitilde} 2) aggregates with a quasi-monodisperse (i.e., narrow) size distribution. We find that, for a wide range of model parameters, the fractal growth is strongly inhibited by the electric repulsion between colliding aggregates and eventually "freezes out" on its way to the subsequent growth stage involving collisional compression. Strong disk turbulence would help the aggregates to overcome this growth barrier, but then it would cause catastrophic collisional fragmentation in later growth stages. These facts suggest that the combination of electric repulsion and collisional fragmentation would impose a serious limitation on dust growth in protoplanetary disks. We propose a possible scenario of dust evolution after the freezeout. Finally, we point out that the fractal growth of dust aggregates tends to maintain a low ionization degree and, as a result, a large magnetorotationally stable region in the disk.},

	abstract = {We investigate where magnetorotational instability operates in protoplanetary disks, which can cause angular momentum transport in the disks. We investigate the spatial distribution of various charged particles and the unstable regions for a variety of models for protoplanetary disks, taking into account the recombination of ions and electrons at grain surfaces, which is an important process in most parts of the disks. We find that for all the models there is an inner region that is magnetorotationally stable due to ohmic dissipation. This must make the accretion onto the central star nonsteady. For the model of the minimum-mass solar nebula, the critical radius, inside of which the disk is stable, is about 20 {AU}, and the mass accretion rate just outside the critical radius is 10-7-10-6 Msolar yr-1. The stable region is smaller in a disk of lower column density. Dust grains in protoplanetary disks may grow by mutual sticking and may sediment toward the midplane of the disks. We find that the stable region shrinks as the grain size increases or the sedimentation proceeds. Therefore, in the late evolutionary stages, protoplanetary disks can be magnetorotationally unstable even in the inner regions.},

	abstract = {We measure the turbulent diffusion coefficient of dust grains embedded in magnetorotational turbulence in a protoplanetary disk directly from numerical simulations and compare it to the turbulent viscosity of the flow. The simulations are done in a local coordinate frame comoving with the gas in Keplerian rotation. Periodic boundary conditions are used in all directions, and vertical gravity is not applied to the gas. Using a two-fluid approach, small dust grains of various sizes (with friction times up to Ω0τf=0.02) are allowed to move under the influence of friction with the turbulent gas. We measure the turbulent diffusion coefficient of the dust grains by applying an external sinusoidal force field acting in the vertical direction on the dust component only. This concentrates the dust around the midplane of the disk, and an equilibrium distribution of the dust density is achieved when the vertical settling is counteracted by the turbulent diffusion away from the midplane. Comparing with analytical expressions for the equilibrium concentration, we deduce the vertical turbulent diffusion coefficient. The vertical diffusion coefficient is found to be lower than the turbulent viscosity and to have an associated vertical Schmidt number (vertical diffusion Prandtl number) of about 1.5. A similar radial force field also allows us to measure the radial turbulent diffusion coefficient. We find a radial Schmidt number of about 0.85 and also find that the radial turbulent diffusion coefficient is around 70\% higher than the vertical. As most angular momentum transport happens through magnetic Maxwell stresses, both the vertical and the radial diffusion coefficients are found to be significantly higher than suggested by the angular momentum transport by Reynolds stresses alone. We also find evidence for trapping of dust grains of intermediate friction time in turbulent eddies.},

	abstract = {Context. The growth processes from protoplanetary dust to planetesimals are not fully understood. Laboratory experiments and theoretical models have shown that collisions among the dust aggregates can lead to sticking, bouncing, and fragmentation. However, no systematic study on the collisional outcome of protoplanetary dust has been performed so far, so that a physical model of the dust evolution in protoplanetary disks is still missing.
Aims: We intend to map the parameter space for the collisional interaction of arbitrarily porous dust aggregates. This parameter space encompasses the dust-aggregate masses, their porosities and the collision velocity. With such a complete mapping of the collisional outcomes of protoplanetary dust aggregates, it will be possible to follow the collisional evolution of dust in a protoplanetary disk environment.
Methods: We use literature data, perform laboratory experiments, and apply simple physical models to get a complete picture of the collisional interaction of protoplanetary dust aggregates.
Results: We found four different kinds of sticking, two kinds of bouncing, and three kinds of fragmentation as possible outcomes in collisions among protoplanetary dust aggregates. Our best collision model distinguishes between porous and compact dust. We also differentiate between collisions among similar-sized and different-sized bodies. All in all, eight combinations of porosity and mass ratio can be discerned. For each of these cases, we present a complete collision model for dust-aggregate masses between 10-12 and 102 g and collision velocities in the range of 10-4 ldots 104 cm s-1 for arbitrary porosities. This model comprises the collisional outcome, the mass(es) of the resulting aggregate(s) and their porosities.
Conclusions: We present the first complete collision model for protoplanetary dust. This collision model can be used for the determination of the dust-growth rate in protoplanetary disks. This paper is dedicated to the memory of our dear friend and colleague Frithjof Brauer (14th March 1980-19th September 2009) who developed powerful models of dust coagulation and fragmentation, and thereby studied the formation of planetesimals beyond the meter size barrier in his {Ph.D.} thesis.

During the period 1950-2003, 58\% of the 86,611 {LSS} cohort members with {DS02} dose estimates have died. The 6 years of additional follow-up since the previous report provide substantially more information at longer periods after radiation exposure (17\% more cancer deaths), especially among those under age 10 at exposure (58\% more deaths). Poisson regression methods were used to investigate the magnitude of the radiation-associated risks, the shape of the dose response, and effect modification by gender, age at exposure, and attained age. The risk of all causes of death was positively associated with radiation dose. Importantly, for solid cancers the additive radiation risk (i.e., excess cancer cases per 10(4) person-years per Gy) continues to increase throughout life with a linear dose-response relationship. The sex-averaged excess relative risk per Gy was 0.42 [95\% confidence interval ({CI):} 0.32, 0.53] for all solid cancer at age 70 years after exposure at age 30 based on a linear model. The risk increased by about 29\% per decade decrease in age at exposure (95\% {CI:} 17\%, 41\%). The estimated lowest dose range with a significant {ERR} for all solid cancer was 0 to 0.20 Gy, and a formal dose-threshold analysis indicated no threshold; i.e., zero dose was the best estimate of the threshold. The risk of cancer mortality increased significantly for most major sites, including stomach, lung, liver, colon, breast, gallbladder, esophagus, bladder and ovary, whereas rectum, pancreas, uterus, prostate and kidney parenchyma did not have significantly increased risks. An increased risk of non-neoplastic diseases including the circulatory, respiratory and digestive systems was observed, but whether these are causal relationships requires further investigation. There was no evidence of a radiation effect for infectious or external causes of death.},

	abstract = {During the initial stages of planet formation in circumstellar gas disks, dust grains collide and build up larger and larger bodies. How this process continues from metre-sized boulders to kilometre-scale planetesimals is a major unsolved problem: boulders are expected to stick together poorly, and to spiral into the protostar in a few hundred orbits owing to a 'headwind' from the slower rotating gas. Gravitational collapse of the solid component has been suggested to overcome this barrier. But even low levels of turbulence will inhibit sedimentation of solids to a sufficiently dense midplane layer, and turbulence must be present to explain observed gas accretion in protostellar disks. Here we report that boulders can undergo efficient gravitational collapse in locally overdense regions in the midplane of the disk. The boulders concentrate initially in transient high pressure regions in the turbulent gas, and these concentrations are augmented a further order of magnitude by a streaming instability driven by the relative flow of gas and solids. We find that gravitationally bound clusters form with masses comparable to dwarf planets and containing a distribution of boulder sizes. Gravitational collapse happens much faster than radial drift, offering a possible path to planetesimal formation in accreting circumstellar disks.},

More than half the surface area of the planet was surveyed. The data include images of lightning against moonlit clouds (illuminated by light from Io) and images of the same storm on the day and night sides. The spatial resolution ranged from 23 to 134 km per pixel, while the storms ranged in size up to {\textasciitilde}1500 km. Most storms were imaged more than once, and they typically exhibit many flashes per minute. The storms occur only in areas of cyclonic shear and near the centers of westward jets. Latitudes near 50 deg in both hemispheres are particularly active, although the northern hemisphere has more lightning overall. The greatest optical energy observed in a single flash was 1.6x1010 J, which is several times larger than terrestrial superbolts. The average optical power per unit area is 3x 10-7 W m-2, which is close to the terrestrial value. The limited color information is consistent with line and continuum emission from atomic hydrogen and helium. The intensity profiles of resolved lightning strikes are bell-shaped, with the half-width at half-maximum ranging from {\textasciitilde}45 to 80 km. We used these widths to infer the depth of the strikes, assuming that the appearance of each is the result of light scattering from a point source below the cloudtops. We conclude that lightning must be occurring within or below the jovian water cloud. The occurrence of lightning in regions of cyclonic shear has important implications for the dynamics of Jupiter's atmosphere.},

	abstract = {The long-wavelength component of the geoid has been used to constrain radial variations in mantle viscosity using 3-D velocity anomaly models determined from seismic tomography as the buoyancy forces driving viscous flow. Using a Genetic Algorithm ({GA)}, the robustness of mantle viscosity models obtained by calculus-based optimization methods is investigated. {GAS} are a relatively new class of optimization techniques, which are generating a growing interest in the geophysics community. These methods can be particularly useful for solving highly non-linear optimization problems. Unlike traditional techniques, {GAS} do not require derivative information to form a Jacobian matrix or sensitivity kernels. Models are constructed from pieces of successful models following a simple set of rules. These simple rules are driven by stochastic, rather than deterministic, means. Because of the efficiency of the {GA} for the mantle viscosity problem, it is possible to explore a greater range of potential solutions than with a traditional optimization method. It is found that, while both calculus-based and {GA} optimization methods find viscosity models with a low-viscosity transition zone, the {GA} finds another class of models, with a high viscosity in the transition zone, that also satisfies the geoid data. The geoid alone is unable to resolve low-viscosity transition-zone models from high-viscosity transition-zone models. The effect of the scaling between seismic velocity and density on the preferred viscosity model is also explored. While a velocity-to-density scaling with a pronounced increase in the transition zone provides the best fit to the geoid, the preferred vertical viscosity profile is insensitive to the velocity-to-density scaling.},

We solve this equation approximately to obtain non-linear sawtooth solutions that are asymptotically valid at late times. In this limit, the presence of shocks is found to cause the wave amplitude to decrease with time as t-2. The validity of the analytic description is confirmed by direct numerical solution of the full non-linear equations of motion. The asymptotic forms of the wave profiles of the state variables are also found to occur in {MRI} simulations, indicating that dissipation due to shocks plays a significant role apart from any effects arising from direct coupling to the turbulence.},

	abstract = {We calculate the ionisation fraction in protostellar disk models using 
two different gas-phase chemical networks, and examine the effect of 
turbulent mixing by modelling the diffusion of chemical species 
vertically through the disk. The aim is to determine in which regions of 
the disk gas can couple to a magnetic field and sustain {MHD} turbulence. 
The disk models are conventional α-disks, and the primary source 
of ionisation is X-ray irradiation from the central star. We assume that 
the vertical mixing arises because of turbulent diffusion, and 
accordingly equate the vertical diffusion coefficient, D, with the 
kinematic viscosity, ν. We find that the effect of diffusion depends 
crucially on the elemental abundance of heavy metals (magnesium) 
included in the chemical model. In the absence of heavy metals, 
diffusion has essentially no effect on the ionisation structure of the 
disks, as the recombination time scale is much shorter than the 
turbulent diffusion time scale. When metals are included with an 
elemental abundance above a threshold value, the diffusion can 
dramatically reduce the size of the magnetically decoupled region ("dead 
zone"), or even remove it altogther. This arises when recombination is 
dominated by metal ions, and the recombination time exceeds the vertical 
diffusion time scale. For a complex chemistry the elemental abundance of 
magnesium required to remove the dead zone is {x\_Mg} = 
10-10-10-8. We also find 
that diffusion can modify the reaction pathways, giving rise to dominant 
species when diffusion is switched on that are minor species when 
diffusion is absent. This suggests that there may be chemical signatures 
of diffusive mixing that could be used to indirectly detect turbulent 
activity in protoplanetary disks. We find examples of models in which 
the dead zone in the outer disk region is rendered deeper when diffusion 
is switched on. This is caused by turbulent mixing diluting the electron 
fraction in regions where the ionisation degree is marginally above that 
required for good coupling. Overall these results suggest that global 
{MHD} turbulence in protoplanetary disks may be self-sustaining under 
favourable circumstances, as turbulent mixing can help maintain the 
ionisation fraction above that necessary to ensure good coupling between 
the gas and magnetic field.},

	url = {http://ads.nao.ac.jp/abs/2008JCoPh.227.8209D},
	abstract = {In this article, a conservative least-squares polynomial reconstruction 
operator is applied to the discontinuous Galerkin method. In a first 
instance, piecewise polynomials of degree N are used as test functions 
as well as to represent the data in each element at the beginning of a 
time step. The time evolution of these data and the flux computation, 
however, are then done with a different set of piecewise polynomials of 
degree {M⩾N}, which are reconstructed from the underlying polynomials 
of degree N. This approach yields a general, unified framework that 
contains as two special cases classical high order finite volume ({FV)} 
schemes (N=0) as well as the usual discontinuous Galerkin ({DG)} method 
({N=M).} In the first case, the polynomial is reconstructed from cell 
averages, for the latter, the reconstruction reduces to the identity 
operator. A completely new class of numerical schemes is generated by 
choosing N≠0 and M{\textgreater}N. The reconstruction operator is implemented 
for arbitrary polynomial degrees N and M on unstructured triangular and 
tetrahedral meshes in two and three space dimensions. To provide a high 
order accurate one-step time integration of the same formal order of 
accuracy as the spatial discretization operator, the (reconstructed) 
polynomial data of degree M are evolved in time locally inside each 
element using a new local continuous space time Galerkin method. As a 
result of this approach, we obtain, as a high order accurate predictor, 
space time polynomials for the vector of conserved variables and for the 
physical fluxes and source terms, which then can be used in a natural 
way to construct very efficient fully-discrete and quadrature-free 
one-step schemes. This feature is particularly important for {DG} schemes 
in three space dimensions, where the cost of numerical quadrature may 
become prohibitively expensive for very high orders of accuracy. 
Numerical convergence studies of all members of the new general class of 
proposed schemes are shown up to sixth-order of accuracy in space and 
time on unstructured two- and three-dimensional meshes for two very 
prominent nonlinear hyperbolic systems, namely for the Euler equations 
of compressible gas dynamics and the equations of ideal 
magnetohydrodynamics ({MHD).} The results indicate that the new class of 
intermediate schemes ({N≠0,M{\textgreater}N)} is computationally more efficient 
than classical finite volume or {DG} schemes. Finally, a large set of 
interesting test cases is solved on unstructured meshes, where the 
proposed new time stepping approach is applied to the equations of ideal 
and relativistic {MHD} as well as to nonlinear elasticity, using a

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.6936},
	abstract = {Observations of H3+ in the Galactic diffuse interstellar medium ({ISM)} have led to various surprising results, including the conclusion that the cosmic-ray ionization rate (zeta\_2) is about 1 order of magnitude larger than previously thought. The present survey expands the sample of diffuse cloud sight lines with H3+ observations to 50, with detections in 21 of those. Ionization rates inferred from these observations are in the range (1.7+-1.3)x10{\textasciicircum}-16 s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textless}zeta\_2{\textless}(10.6+-8.2)x10{\textasciicircum}-16 s{\textasciicircum}-1 with a mean value of zeta\_2=(3.5{\textasciicircum}+5.3\_-3.0)x10{\textasciicircum}-16 s{\textasciicircum}-1. Upper limits (3 sigma) derived from non-detections of H3+ are as low as zeta\_2{\textless}0.4x10{\textasciicircum}-16 s{\textasciicircum}-1. These low upper-limits, in combination with the wide range of inferred cosmic-ray ionization rates, indicate variations in zeta\_2 between different diffuse cloud sight lines. A study of zeta\_2 versus {N\_H} (total hydrogen column density) shows that the two parameters are not correlated for diffuse molecular cloud sight lines, but that the ionization rate decreases when {N\_H} increases to values typical of dense molecular clouds. Both the difference in ionization rates between diffuse and dense clouds and the variation of zeta\_2 among diffuse cloud sight lines are likely the result of particle propagation effects. The lower ionization rate in dense clouds is due to the inability of low-energy (few {MeV)} protons to penetrate such regions, while the ionization rate in diffuse clouds is controlled by the proximity of the observed cloud to a site of particle acceleration.},

	abstract = {The most promising source of gravitational waves for the planned kilometer-size laser-interferometer detectors {LIGO} and {VIRGO} are merging compact binaries, i.e., neutron-star-neutron-star ({NS-NS)}, neutron-star-black-hole ({NS-BH)}, and black-hole-black-hole ({BH-BH)} binaries. We investigate how accurately the distance to the source and the masses and spins of the two bodies will be measured from the inspiral gravitational wave signals by the three-detector {LIGO-VIRGO} network using ``advanced detectors'' (those present a few years after initial operation). The large number of cycles in the observable waveform increases our sensitivity to those parameters that affect the inspiral rate, and thereby the evolution of the waveform's phase. These parameters are thus measured much more accurately than parameters which affect the waveform's polarization or amplitude. To lowest order in a post-Newtonian expansion, the evolution of the waveform's phase depends only on the combination {scrM≡(M1M2)3/5(M1+M2)-1/5} of the masses M1 and M2 of the two bodies, which is known as the ``chirp mass.'' To post-1-Newtonian order, the waveform's phase also depends sensitively on the binary's reduced mass {μ≡M1M2/(M1+M2)} allowing, in principle, a measurement of both M1 and M2 with high accuracy. We show that the principal obstruction to measuring M1 and M2 is the post-1.5-Newtonian effect of the bodies' spins on the waveform's phase, which can mimic the effects that allow μ to be determined. The chirp mass is measurable with an accuracy {ΔscrM/scrM{\textasciitilde}=0.1\%-1\%.} Although this is a remarkably small error bar, it is {\textasciitilde}10 times larger than previous estimates of {ΔscrM/scrM} which neglected post-Newtonian effects. The reduced mass is measurable to {\textasciitilde}10\%-15\% for {NS-NS} and {NS-BH} binaries, and {\textasciitilde}50\% for {BH-BH} binaries (assuming {10Msolar} {BH's).} Measurements of the masses and spins are strongly correlated; there is a combination of μ and the spin angular momenta that is measured to within {\textasciitilde}1\%. Moreover, if both spins were somehow known to be small ({\textless}{\textasciitilde}{0.01M21} and {\textless}{\textasciitilde}{0.01M22}, respectively), then μ could be determined to within {\textasciitilde}1\%. Finally, building on earlier work of Marković, we derive an approximate, analytic expression for the accuracy {ΔD} of mesurements of the distance D to the binary, for an arbitrary network of detectors. This expression is accurate to linear order in 1/ρ, where ρ is the signal-to-noise ratio. We also show that, contrary to previous expectations, contributions to {ΔD/D} that are nonlinear in 1/ρ are significant, and we develop an approximation scheme for including the dominant of these nonlinear effects. Using a Monte Carlo simulation we estimate that distance measurement accuracies will be {\textless}=15\% for {\textasciitilde}8\% of the detected signals, and {\textless}=30\% for {\textasciitilde}60\% of the signals, for the {LIGO-VIRGO} three-detector network.},

	abstract = {We present a global magnetohydrodynamics ({MHD)} simulation of a turbulent accretion disc interacting with a giant protoplanet of 5 Jupiter masses in a fixed circular orbit. The disc model had an aspect ratio H/r= 0.1, and in the absence of the protoplanet a typical value of the Shakura-Sunyaev stress parameter α= 5 × 10-3. As expected from previous work, the protoplanet was found to open and maintain a significant gap in the disc, with the interaction leading to inward migration of the protoplanet orbit on the expected time-scale. No evidence for a persistent net mass flow through the gap was found. However, this may be because an extensive inner cavity could not be formed for the model adopted. Spiral waves were launched by the protoplanet and, although these appeared to be diffused and dissipated through interaction with the turbulence, they produced an outward angular momentum flow which compensated for a reduced flux associated with the {MHD} turbulence near the planet, so maintaining the gap. When compared with laminar disc models, with the same estimated α in the absence of the planet, the gap was found to be deeper and wider, indicating that the turbulent disc behaved as if it in fact possessed a smaller α, even though analysis of the turbulent stress indicated that it was not significantly affected by the planet in the region away from the gap. This may arise for two reasons. First, unlike a Navier-Stokes viscosity with anomalous viscosity coefficient, the turbulence does not provide a source of constantly acting friction in the near vicinity of the planet that leads to steady mass flow into the gap region. Instead, the turbulence is characterized by large fluctuations in the radial velocity, and time averaging of these fluctuations over significant time-scales is required to recover the underlying mass flow through the disc. In the vicinity of the planet, the disc material experiences high amplitude periodic perturbations on time-scales that are short relative to the time-scale required for averaging. Consequently the disc response is likely to be significantly altered relative to that expected from a Navier-Stokes model. Secondly, the simulation indicates that an ordered magnetic connection between the inner and outer disc can occur enabling angular momentum to flow out across the gap, helping to maintain it independently of the protoplanet's tide. This type of effect may assist gap formation for smaller mass protoplanets which otherwise would not be able to maintain them. There is also some evidence that magnetic connection between the circumstellar disc and material that flows into the protoplanet's Hill sphere may lead to significant magnetic braking of the resulting circumplanetary disc, thereby modifying the expected gas accretion rate on to forming gas giant planets.},

	abstract = {The bulk density of dust aggregates is an important factor in 
collisional growth of dust in protoplanetary disks. The density of 
aggregates changes the coupling with the disk gas, which governs the 
motion of aggregates in disks. Collisional outcomes also depend on the 
aggregate density. We perform three-dimensional N-body simulations of 
sequential collisions of aggregates composed of a number of 
submicron-sized icy particles in order to investigate the density 
evolution of dust aggregates growing in protoplanetary disks. In the 
present simulation of sequential collisions, as the initial aggregates 
at each collision, we use the resultant aggregate obtained at the 
previous collision. By repeating N-body calculations of aggregate 
collisions, we examined the density evolution of aggregate collisions. 
At an early stage of dust growth, aggregates stick to each other without 
restructuring, and the density of these aggregates decreases. At a later 
stage, in which the impact energy exceeds a critical energy, aggregates 
are gradually compressed. The compressed aggregates have a fractal 
dimension of 2.5. Because of this small fractal dimension, their density 
remains very low even at this compression stage. We also derive an 
equation describing the density evolution of growing aggregates. 
Applying this equation to dust growth in protoplanetary disks, we find 
that dust aggregates have an extremely low density ({\textless}0.1 kg 
m-3). In the simulation of the present study, we consider 
only head-on collisions. The effect of oblique collisions would further 
reduce the aggregate density.},

	abstract = {Using three-dimensional numerical simulations, we have found that the weak-field magnetorotational instability constitutes a hydromagnetic dynamo in astrophysical disks. The field amplification mechanism lies outside the scope of kinematic dynamo theory and implies that kinematic dynamo theory is not applicable to accretion disk systems. We begin with simulations of isotropic, homogeneous turbulence to demonstrate the ability of our finite-difference code to reproduce known dynamos. To calibrate our code, we measure magnetic field rates when the turbulent velocity field is not sustained through external forcing. When the turbulence is maintained with imposed velocity fields, a magnetic dynamo can be produced. Two cases are considered: velocity fields with and without net helicity. Both the helical and the nonhelical velocity fields amplify and sustain magnetic fields despite substantial turbulent dissipation. The nonhelical dynamo increases the magnetic field energy by an order of magnitude. The helical dynamo produces greater amplification (a factor of 30 in energy) and a more ordered field. Lorentz forces eventually limit the growth of the magnetic field in both cases. We next carry out simulations in the local shearing box model of an accretion disk. The initial magnetic field has a mean field value of zero over the computational domain and is weak in the sense that the initial Alfvén speed is much less than the sound speed. The magnetorotational instability rapidly generates turbulence within the disk. The turbulence is anisotropic, producing significant Maxwell and Reynolds stresses that transport angular momentum outward. Both the stresses and magnetic energy density remain subthermal and do not approach equipartition. The magnetic energy is amplified by a factor of 20 and maintained for over 200 orbits of time, far longer than the magnetic decay time in the absence of an amplification mechanism. A parameter survey indicates the final turbulent state does not depend on the initial average field strength; some dependence on the computational domain size, magnetic Prandtl number, and numerical resolution is observed. Finally, we demonstrate explicitly that more than shear and turbulence are required to produce dynamo amplification of magnetic fields.},

	abstract = {Context. Based on the viscous disk theory, a number of recent studies have suggested there is large-scale meridional circulation in protoplanetary disks. Such a flow could account for the presence of crystalline silicates, including calcium- and aluminum-rich inclusions ({CAIs)}, at large distances from the sun.
Aims: This paper aims at examining whether such large-scale flows exist in turbulent protoplanetary disks.
Methods: High-resolution global hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical ({MHD)} numerical simulations of turbulent protoplanetary disks were used to infer the properties of the flow in such disks.
Results: By performing hydrodynamic simulations using explicit viscosity, we demonstrate that our numerical setup does not suffer from any numerical artifact. The aforementioned meridional circulation is easily recovered in viscous and laminar disks and is quickly established. In {MHD} simulations, the magnetorotational instability drives turbulence in the disks. Averaging out the turbulent fluctuations on a long timescale, the results fail to show any large-scale meridional circulation. A detailed analysis of the simulations show that this lack of meridional circulation is due to the turbulent stress tensor having a vertical profile different from the viscous stress tensor. A simple model is provided that successfully accounts for the structure of the flow in the bulk of the disk. In addition to those results, possible deviations from standard vertically averaged α disk models are suggested by the simulations and should be the focus of future work.
Conclusions: Global {MHD} numerical simulations of fully ionized and turbulent protoplanetary disks are not consistent with the existence of a large-scale meridional flow. As a consequence, the presence of crystalline silicates at large distance of the central star cannot be accounted for by that process as suggested by recent models based on viscous disk theory.},

Furthermore, we develop the properties of applicative functors and the generic operations they support.

	abstract = {A variety of supernova events, including Type {IIn} supernovae and ultraluminous supernovae, appear to have lost up to solar masses of their envelopes in 10's to 100's of years leading up to the explosion. In order to explain the close timing of the mass loss and supernova events, we explore the possibility that the mass loss is driven by common envelope evolution of a compact object (neutron star or black hole) in the envelope of a massive star and the supernova is triggered by the inspiral of the compact object to the central core of the companion star. The expected rate of such events is smaller than the observed rate of Type {IIn} supernovae but the rates may agree within the uncertainties. The mass loss velocity is related to the escape velocity from the common envelope system and is comparable to the observed velocity of 100's of km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ in Type {IIn} events. The mass loss is expected to be denser near the equatorial plane of the binary system and there is good evidence that the circumstellar media in Type {IIn} supernovae are asymmetric. Some of these supernova types show evidence for energies in excess of the canonical \$10{\textasciicircum}\{51\}\$ ergs, which might be the result of explosions from rapid accretion onto a compact object through a disk.},

Aims. We explore methods to measure the near-infrared extinction law produced by dense material in molecular cloud cores from photometric data. Methods. Using controlled sets of synthetic and semi-synthetic data, we test several methods for linear regression applied to the specific problem of deriving the extinction law from photometric data.

We find that many of the common linear-regression methods produce biased results when applied to the extinction law from photometric colors.

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJ...528..462H},
	abstract = {Global time-dependent simulations provide a means to investigate 
time-dependent dynamic evolution in accretion disks. This paper seeks to 
extend previous local simulations by beginning a systematic effort to 
develop fully global three-dimensional simulations. The nonlinear 
development of the magnetorotational instability is investigated using a 
time-explicit finite difference code written in cylindrical coordinates. 
The equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics are solved with the 
assumption of an adiabatic equation of state. Both a Newtonian potential 
and a pseudo-Newtonian potential are used. Two simplifications are also 
explored: a cylindrical gravitational potential (the ``cylindrical 
disk'') and axisymmetry. The results from those simulations are compared 
with fully three-dimensional global simulations. The global simulations 
begin with equilibrium pressure-supported accretion tori. Two different 
initial field geometries are investigated: poloidal fields that are 
constant along initial equidensity surfaces and toroidal fields with a 
constant ratio of gas to magnetic pressure. In both cases the 
magnetorotational instability rapidly develops and the torus becomes 
turbulent. The resulting turbulence transports angular momentum, and the 
torus develops an angular momentum distribution that is near Keplerian. 
A comparison with axisymmetric simulations shows that in three 
dimensions the magnetorotational instability can act as a dynamo and 
regenerate poloidal field, thereby sustaining the turbulence. As 
previously observed in local simulations, the stress is dominated by the 
Maxwell component. The total stress in the interior of the disk is 
{\textasciitilde}0.1-0.2 times the thermal pressure. At late time the disks are 
characterized by relatively thick configurations, with rapid time 
dependence and tightly wrapped, low-m spiral structures.},

affects the evolution of solid bodies in protoplanetary disks. On the 
other hand, small dust particles stabilize {MRI} by capturing ionized gas 
particles needed for the coupling of the gas and magnetic fields. To 
provide an empirical basis for modeling the coevolution of dust and {MRI}, 
we perform three-dimensional, ohmic-resistive {MHD} simulations of a 
vertically stratified shearing box with an {MRI-inactive} "dead zone" of 
various sizes and with a net vertical magnetic flux of various 
strengths. We find that the vertical structure of turbulence is well 
characterized by the vertical magnetic flux and three critical heights 
derived from the linear analysis of {MRI} in a stratified disk. In 
particular, the turbulent structure depends on the resistivity profile 
only through the critical heights and is insensitive to the details of 
the resistivity profile. We discover scaling relations between the 
amplitudes of various turbulent quantities (velocity dispersion, density 
fluctuation, vertical diffusion coefficient, and outflow mass flux) and 
vertically integrated accretion stresses. We also obtain empirical 
formulae for the integrated accretion stresses as a function of the 
vertical magnetic flux and the critical heights. These empirical 
relations allow us to predict the vertical turbulent structure of a

	abstract = {Young circumbinary disks are expected to supply gas onto protoplanetary 
disks through accretion. Such mass supply has been studied based on new 
{2D} numerical simulations in which a circular binary is surrounded by an 
isothermal Keplerian disk at the initial stage. The simulations show 
that the gas supply is variable due to oscillation of spiral waves in 
the circumbinary disk. The amplitude of the oscillation varies on the 
timescale of several tens rotation period. The gas supply rate is 
positively correlated with the amplitude of the oscillation. The gas is 
supplied through the L2 point to protoplanetary disks associated with 
the primary and secondary. The mass accretion rate tends to be higher 
for the primary disk although the secondary disk has a higher accretion 
rate in certain periods. The primary disk is perturbed so intensely by 
the impact of gas flow that the outer part is removed. Conversely, the 
secondary disk is quiet most of the time. Both the primary and secondary 
disks have travelling spiral waves which transfer angular momentum 
inside them. The mass supply from the circumbinary disk is higher when 
the temperature is higher. The inner edge of the circumbinary disk 
retreats gradually.},

	abstract = {We apply a new, second-order Godunov code, Athena, to studies of the magnetorotational instability ({MRI)} using unstratified shearing box simulations with a uniform net vertical field and a sinusoidally varying zero net vertical field. The Athena results agree well with similar studies that used different numerical algorithms, including the observation that the turbulent energy decreases with increasing resolution in the zero net field model. We conduct analyses to study the flow of energy from differential rotation to turbulent fluctuations to thermalization. A study of the time correlation between the rates of change of different volume-averaged energy components shows that energy injected into turbulent fluctuations dissipates on a timescale of Ω-1, where Ω is the orbital frequency of the local domain. Magnetic dissipation dominates over kinetic dissipation, although not by as great a factor as the ratio of magnetic to kinetic energy. We Fourier-transform the magnetic and kinetic energy evolution equations and, using the assumption that the time-averaged energies are constant, determine the level of numerical dissipation as a function of length scale and resolution. By modeling numerical dissipation as if it were physical in origin, we characterize numerical resistivity and viscosity in terms of effective Reynolds and Prandtl numbers. The resulting effective magnetic Prandtl number is {\textasciitilde}2, independent of resolution or initial field geometry. {MRI} simulations with effective Reynolds and Prandtl numbers determined by numerical dissipation are not equivalent to those where these numbers are set by physical resistivity and viscosity. These results serve, then, as a baseline for future shearing box studies where dissipation is controlled by the inclusion of explicit viscosity and resistivity.},

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998RvMP...70....1B},
	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed dramatic progress in our understanding of how turbulence arises and transports angular momentum in astrophysical accretion disks. The key conceptual point has its origins in work dating from the 1950s, but its implications have been fully understood only in the last several years: the combination of a subthermal magnetic field (any nonpathological configuration will do) and outwardly decreasing differential rotation rapidly generates magnetohydrodynamic ({MHD)} turbulence via a remarkably simple linear instability. The result is a greatly enhanced effective viscosity, the origin of which had been a long-standing problem. The {MHD} nature of disk turbulence has linked two broad domains of magnetized fluid research: accretion theory and dynamos. The understanding that weak magnetic fields are not merely passively acted upon by turbulence, but actively generate it, means that the assumptions of classical dynamo theory break down in disks. Paralleling the new conceptual understanding has been the development of powerful numerical {MHD} codes. These have taught us that disks truly are turbulent, transporting angular momentum at greatly enhanced rates. We have also learned, however, that not all forms of disk turbulence do this. Purely hydrodynamic turbulence, when it is imposed, simply causes fluctuations without a significant increase in transport. The interplay between numerical simulation and analytic arguments has been particularly fruitful in accretion disk theory and is a major focus of this article. The authors conclude with a summary of what is now known of disk turbulence and mention some knotty outstanding questions (e.g., what is the physics behind nonlinear field saturation?) for which we may soon begin to develop answers.},

Considerable progress has been made over the past years in the physical description of the first stages of planetesimal formation, owing to extensive laboratory work. This review examines the experimental achievements and puts them into the context of the dust processes in protoplanetary disks. It has become clear that planetesimal formation starts with the growth of fractal dust aggregates, followed by compaction processes. As the dust-aggregate sizes increase, the mean collision velocity also increases, leading to the stalling of the growth and possibly to fragmentation, once the dust aggregates have reached decimeter sizes. A multitude of hypotheses for the further growth have been proposed, such as very sticky materials, secondary collision processes, enhanced growth at the snow line, or cumulative dust effects with gravitational instability. We will also critically review these ideas.},

dominant contribution to alpha comes from magnetic stresses, which are 
enhanced by the presence of weak net vertical fields. The power spectra 
of the magnetic fields are flat or decline only slowly toward the 
largest scales accessible in the calculation, suggesting that the

quantity. I discuss how these results compare with observationally

	volume = {409},

	abstract = {Angular momentum transport and accretion in protoplanetary discs are generally believed to be driven by magnetohydrodynamics ({MHD)} turbulence via the magnetorotational instability ({MRI).} The dynamics of solid bodies embedded in such discs (dust grains, boulders, planetesimals and planets) may be strongly affected by the turbulence, such that the formation pathways for planetary systems are determined in part by the strength and spatial distribution of the turbulent flow. We examine the dynamics of planetesimals, with radii between 1m and 10km, embedded in turbulent protoplanetary discs, using {3D} {MHD} simulations. The planetesimals experience gas drag and stochastic gravitational forces due to the turbulent disc. We use, and compare the results from, local shearing box simulations and global models in this study. The main aims of this work are to examine: the growth, and possible saturation, of the velocity dispersion of embedded planetesimals as a function of their size and disc parameters; the rate of radial migration and diffusion of planetesimals; the conditions under which the results from shearing box and global simulations agree. We find good agreement between local and global simulations when shearing boxes of dimension {4H} × {16H} × {2H} are used (H being the local scaleheight). The magnitude of the density fluctuations obtained is sensitive to the box size, due to the excitation and propagation of spiral density waves. This affects the stochastic forcing experienced by planetesimals. The correlation time associated with the stochastic forcing is also found to be a function of the box size and aspect ratio. The equilibrium radial velocity dispersion, σ(vr), obtained depends on the radii, Rp, of the planetesimals. Bodies with Rp = 50m achieve the smallest value with σ(vr) {\textasciitilde}= 20ms-1. Smaller bodies are tightly coupled to the gas, and boulders with Rp = 1m attain a value of σ(vr) similar to the turbulent velocity of the gas ({\textasciitilde}100ms-1). Equilibrium values of σ(vr) for bodies larger than 100m are not achieved in our simulations, but in all models we find rapid growth of the velocity dispersion for planetesimals of size 1 and 10km, such that σ(vr) {\textgreater}= 160ms-1 after a run time of 1200 orbits at a distance of 5au from the central star. These values are too large to allow for the runaway growth of planetesimals, and mutual collisions would lead to catastrophic disruption. Radial migration due to gas drag is observed for bodies with Rp {\textasciitilde}= 1m, and is only modestly affected by the turbulence. Larger bodies undergo a random walk in their semimajor axes, leading to radial diffusion through the disc. For our fiducial disc model, we estimate that radial diffusion across a distance of {\textasciitilde}=2.5au would occur for typical planetesimals in a swarm located at 5au over a disc lifetime of {5Myr.} Radial diffusion of this magnitude appears to be inconsistent with Solar system constraints. Our models show that fully developed magnetohydrodynamics ({MHD)} turbulence in protoplanetary discs would have a destructive effect on embedded planetesimals. Relatively low levels of turbulence are required for traditional models of planetesimal accretion to operate, this being consistent with the existence of a dead zone in protoplanetary discs.},

too small for significant heating and ionization to occur in the 
discharge channels associated with the wave. It is inferred that 
lightning discharges in the protosolar nebula, if they were responsible 
for the melting of chondrules, must have been powered by electrical 
energy stored in much larger structures. It is argued that the strong

	abstract = {We investigate the stability of uniformly magnetized accretion disks, including the effect of ohmic dissipation. The growth of axisymmetric local and global modes is examined using linear perturbation theory. A simple local analysis shows that the dissipation process generally suppresses the growth of magnetorotational instability when the magnetic Reynolds number is less than unity. The characteristic length scale of unstable modes becomes longer than that of the ideal {MHD} case, and its unstable growth rate is inversely proportional to the magnetic diffusivity. We perform a global linear analysis in which the vertical structure of the disk is considered. The growth rate of the magnetorotational instability is obtained by solving eigen equations numerically. We find that the conditions for existing unstable global modes are beta\_c{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1 and {beta\_cR\_mc{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1}, where beta\_c and R\_mc are the plasma beta value and the magnetic Reynolds number defined at the midplane of the disk. The global stability criteria are approximately given by whether the minimum unstable wavelength expected by the local analysis would be shorter than the scale height of the disk or not. We also find unstable modes whose eigenfunctions of the perturbed velocities have amplitude localized near the surface layer of the disk. These unstable modes indicate layered accretion in the nonlinear regime. We apply the results of linear analysis to protoplanetary disks. For the case of the minimum-mass solar nebula, the magnetorotational instability occurs at the region farther out than 15 {AU.} This result suggests nonsteady accretion onto a central star in protoplanetary disks.},

The cooling function of the shock is directly proportional to temperature raised to the power alpha. An oscillatory instability similar to that found in numerical calculations of accretion onto degenerate dwarfs is investigated, and it is shown that multiple modes of oscillation are possible. Oscillation frequencies are determined, along with the values of alpha for which the various modes are unstable. It is concluded that the instability may explain why steady-state shock-wave models cannot reproduce certain observations of old supernova remnants and Herbig-Haro objects.},

To avoid the increase of numerical errors caused by suppressing the information contained in Gauss' law as well as the divergence-free condition of the magnetic induction, a divergence cleaning step is added which does not require the solution of a Poisson equation. The elliptical constraints of the Maxwell equations is approximated by a hyperbolic condition, starting from the so-called Generalised Lagrange Multiplier Maxwell model. This results in a purely hyperbolic system that fits very well in the framework of high-resolution finite-volume schemes yielding an efficient and flexible parallel Maxwell solver for explicit field calculations in time domain on unstructured grids in three space dimensions. Simulation results obtained with this new approximation technique are presented and compared with analytical as well as with other methods.},

	abstract = {By constructing a global model based on three-dimensional local magnetohydrodynamical simulations, we show that the disk wind driven by magnetorotational instability ({MRI)} plays a significant role in the dispersal of the gas component of protoplanetary disks. Because the mass loss timescale of the {MRI-driven} disk winds is proportional to the local Keplerian rotation period, a gas disk dynamically evaporates from the inner region, possibly creating a gradually expanding inner hole, while a sizable amount of the gas remains in the outer region. The disk wind is highly time dependent with a quasi-periodicity of several times the Keplerian rotation period at each radius, which will be observed as the time variability of protostar-protoplanetary disk systems. These features persistently hold even if a dead zone exists because the disk winds are driven from the surface regions where ionizing cosmic rays and high energy photons can penetrate. Moreover, the predicted inside-out clearing significantly suppresses the infall of boulders to a central star and the type I migration of proto-planets, which are favorable for the formation and survival of planets.},

	abstract = {Mars' dynamic atmosphere displays localized dust devils and larger, 
global dust storms. Based on terrestrial analog studies, electrostatic 
modeling, and laboratory work, these features will contain large 
electrostatic fields formed via triboelectric processes. In the 
low-pressure Martian atmosphere, these fields may create an electron 
avalanche and collisional plasma due to an increase in electron density 
driven by the internal electrical forces. To test the hypothesis that an 
electron avalanche is sustained under these conditions, a 
self-consistent atmospheric process model is created including electron 
impact ionization sources and electron losses via dust absorption, 
electron dissociation attachment, and electron/ion recombination. This 
new model is called the Dust Devil Electron Avalanche Model ({DDEAM).} 
This model solves simultaneously nine continuity equations describing 
the evolution of the primary gaseous chemical species involved in the 
electrochemistry. {DDEAM} monitors the evolution of the electrons and 
primary gas constituents, including electron/water interactions. We 
especially focus on electron dynamics and follow the electrons as they 
evolve in the E field driven collisional gas. When sources and losses 
are self-consistently included in the electron continuity equation, the 
electron density grows exponentially with increasing electric field, 
reaching an equilibrium that forms a sustained time-stable collisional 
plasma. However, the character of this plasma differs depending upon the 
assumed growth rate saturation process (chemical saturation versus space 
charge). {DDEAM} also shows the possibility of the loss of atmospheric 
methane as a function of electric field due to electron dissociative 
attachment of the hydrocarbon. The methane destruction rates are 
presented and can be included in other larger atmospheric models.},

'viscosities', one governing shear within the plane of the disc and the 
other governing shear perpendicular to the disc (brought about by 
non-planarity of the disc). It is shown that these equations can be put 
in numerical difference form so that angular momentum is locally 
conserved. Numerical simulations are given for two simple cases, the 
evolution of a simple twist in a steady Keplerian accretion disc, and 
the effect of precession about an axis which is not aligned with the 
disc on the inner regions of the disc (the Bardeen-Petterson effect). It 
is emphasized that the methods presented here can be applied to more 
general rotation laws, and precession rates - for example, warped
